🆕 Release $version is out! Thanks to $contributor for the PR 👏

Strawberry GraphQL now supports @apollographql's multipart subscriptions! 🎉

This means that when using the Apollo Client libraries you don't need to install
any additional dependency, but in future this feature should make it easier for
us to implement `@defer` and `@stream`.
