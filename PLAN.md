# ✅ COMPLETED: First-class Pydantic Support Implementation

Plan to add first class support for Pydantic, similar to how it was outlined here:

https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/issues/2181

## Original Goal

We have already support for pydantic, but it is experimental, and works like this:

```python
class UserModel(BaseModel):
    age: int

@strawberry.experimental.pydantic.type(
    UserModel, all_fields=True
)
class User: ...
```

The issue is that we need to create a new class that for the GraphQL type,
it would be nice to remove this requirement and do this instead:

```python
@strawberry.pydantic.type
class UserModel(BaseModel):
    age: int
```

This means we can directly pass a pydantic model to the strawberry pydantic type decorator.

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETED

### ✅ Core Implementation
- **Created `strawberry/pydantic/` module** with first-class Pydantic support
- **Implemented `@strawberry.pydantic.type` decorator** that directly decorates Pydantic BaseModel classes
- **Added `@strawberry.pydantic.input` decorator** for GraphQL input types
- **Added `@strawberry.pydantic.interface` decorator** for GraphQL interfaces
- **Custom field processing function** `_get_pydantic_fields()` that handles Pydantic models without requiring dataclass structure
- **Automatic field inclusion** - all fields from Pydantic model are included by default
- **Type registration and conversion methods** - `from_pydantic()` and `to_pydantic()` methods added automatically
- **Proper GraphQL type resolution** with `is_type_of()` method

### ✅ Advanced Features
- **Field descriptions** - Pydantic field descriptions are preserved in GraphQL schema
- **Field aliases** - Optional support for using Pydantic field aliases as GraphQL field names
- **Private fields** - Support for `strawberry.Private[T]` to exclude fields from GraphQL schema while keeping them accessible in Python
- **Validation integration** - Pydantic validation works seamlessly with GraphQL input types
- **Nested types** - Full support for nested Pydantic models
- **Optional fields** - Proper handling of `Optional[T]` fields
- **Lists and collections** - Support for `List[T]` and other collection types

### ✅ Files Created/Modified
- `strawberry/pydantic/__init__.py` - Main module exports
- `strawberry/pydantic/fields.py` - Custom field processing for Pydantic models
- `strawberry/pydantic/object_type.py` - Core decorators (type, input, interface)
- `strawberry/__init__.py` - Updated to export new pydantic module
- `tests/pydantic/test_basic.py` - 18 comprehensive tests for basic functionality
- `tests/pydantic/test_execution.py` - 14 execution tests for GraphQL schema execution
- `docs/integrations/pydantic.md` - Complete documentation with examples and migration guide

### ✅ Test Coverage
- **32 tests total** - All passing
- **Basic functionality tests** - Type definitions, field processing, conversion methods
- **Execution tests** - Query/mutation execution, validation, async support
- **Private field tests** - Schema exclusion and Python accessibility
- **Edge cases** - Nested types, lists, aliases, validation errors

### ✅ Key Features Implemented
1. **Direct BaseModel decoration**: `@strawberry.pydantic.type` directly on Pydantic models
2. **All field inclusion**: Automatically includes all fields from the Pydantic model
3. **No wrapper classes**: Eliminates need for separate GraphQL type classes
4. **Full type system support**: Types, inputs, and interfaces
5. **Pydantic v2+ compatibility**: Works with latest Pydantic versions
6. **Clean API**: Much simpler than experimental integration
7. **Backward compatibility**: Experimental integration continues to work

### ✅ Migration Path
Users can migrate from:
```python
# Before (Experimental)
@strawberry.experimental.pydantic.type(UserModel, all_fields=True)
class User:
    pass
```

To:
```python
# After (First-class)
@strawberry.pydantic.type
class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int
```

### ✅ Documentation
- **Complete integration guide** in `docs/integrations/pydantic.md`
- **Migration instructions** from experimental to first-class
- **Code examples** for all features
- **Best practices** and limitations
- **Configuration options** for all decorators

## Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

This implementation successfully achieves the original goal of providing first-class Pydantic support that eliminates the need for wrapper classes while maintaining full compatibility with Pydantic v2+ and providing a clean, intuitive API.
