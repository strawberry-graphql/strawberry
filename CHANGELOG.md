CHANGELOG
=========

0.133.1 - 2022-09-28
--------------------

This release fixes an issue that prevented using `strawberry.field` with
`UNSET` as the default value.

Contributed by [Patrick Arminio](https://github.com/patrick91) via [PR #2128](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2128/)


0.133.0 - 2022-09-27
--------------------

Reduce the number of required dependencies, by marking Pygments and python-multipart as optional. These dependencies are still necessary for some functionality, and so users of that functionality need to ensure they're installed, either explicitly or via an extra:

- Pygments is still necessary when using Strawberry in debug mode, and is included in the `strawberry[debug-server]` extra.
- python-multipart is still necessary when using `strawberry.file_uploads.Upload` with FastAPI or Starlette, and is included in the `strawberry[fastapi]` and `strawberry[asgi]` extras, respectively.

There is now also the `strawberry[cli]` extra to support commands like `strawberry codegen` and `strawberry export-schema`.

Contributed by [Huon Wilson](https://github.com/huonw) via [PR #2205](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2205/)


0.132.1 - 2022-09-23
--------------------

Improve resolving performance by avoiding extra calls for basic fields.

This change improves performance of resolving a query by skipping `Info`
creation and permission checking for fields that don't have a resolver
or permission classes. In local benchmarks it improves performance of large
results by ~14%.

Contributed by [Jonathan Kim](https://github.com/jkimbo) via [PR #2194](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2194/)


0.132.0 - 2022-09-23
--------------------

Support storing metadata in strawberry fields.

Contributed by [Paulo Costa](https://github.com/paulo-raca) via [PR #2190](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2190/)


0.131.5 - 2022-09-22
--------------------

Fixes false positives with the mypy plugin.
Happened when `to_pydantic` was called on a type that was converted
pydantic with all_fields=True.

Also fixes the type signature when `to_pydantic` is defined by the user.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional
import strawberry


class MyModel(BaseModel):
    email: str
    password: Optional[str]


@strawberry.experimental.pydantic.input(model=MyModel, all_fields=True)
class MyModelStrawberry:
    ...

MyModelStrawberry(email="").to_pydantic()
# previously would complain wrongly about missing email and password
```

Contributed by [James Chua](https://github.com/thejaminator) via [PR #2017](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2017/)


0.131.4 - 2022-09-22
--------------------

This release updates the mypy plugin and the typing for Pyright to treat all
strawberry fields as keyword-only arguments. This reflects a previous change to
the Strawberry API.

Contributed by [Paulo Costa](https://github.com/paulo-raca) via [PR #2191](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2191/)


0.131.3 - 2022-09-22
--------------------

Bug fix: Do not force kw-only=False in fields specified with strawberry.field()

Contributed by [Paulo Costa](https://github.com/paulo-raca) via [PR #2189](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2189/)


0.131.2 - 2022-09-22
--------------------

This release fixes a small issue that might happen when
uploading files and not passing the operations object.

Contributed by [Patrick Arminio](https://github.com/patrick91) via [PR #2192](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2192/)


0.131.1 - 2022-09-16
--------------------

Fix warnings during unit tests for Sanic's upload.

Otherwise running unit tests results in a bunch of warning like this:

```
DeprecationWarning: Use 'content=<...>' to upload raw bytes/text content.
```

Contributed by [Paulo Costa](https://github.com/paulo-raca) via [PR #2178](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2178/)


0.131.0 - 2022-09-15
--------------------

This release improves the dataloader class with new features:

- Explicitly cache invalidation, prevents old data from being fetched after a mutation
- Importing data into the cache, prevents unnecessary load calls if the data has already been fetched by other means.

Contributed by [Paulo Costa](https://github.com/paulo-raca) via [PR #2149](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2149/)


0.130.4 - 2022-09-14
--------------------

This release adds improved support for Pyright and Pylance, VSCode default
language server for Python.

Using `strawberry.type`, `strawberry.field`, `strawberry.input` and
`strawberry.enum` will now be correctly recognized by Pyright and Pylance and
won't show errors.

Contributed by [Patrick Arminio](https://github.com/patrick91) via [PR #2172](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2172/)


0.130.3 - 2022-09-12
--------------------

Fix invalid deprecation warning issued on arguments annotated
by a subclassed `strawberry.types.Info`.

Thanks to @ThirVondukr for the bug report!

Example:

```python
class MyInfo(Info)
    pass

@strawberry.type
class Query:

    @strawberry.field
    def is_tasty(self, info: MyInfo) -> bool:
        """Subclassed ``info`` argument no longer raises deprecation warning."""
```

Contributed by [San Kilkis](https://github.com/skilkis) via [PR #2137](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2137/)


0.130.2 - 2022-09-12
--------------------

This release fixes the conversion of generic aliases when
using pydantic.

Contributed by [Silas Sewell](https://github.com/silas) via [PR #2152](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2152/)


0.130.1 - 2022-09-12
--------------------

Fix version parsing issue related to dev builds of Mypy in `strawberry.ext.mypy_plugin`

Contributed by [San Kilkis](https://github.com/skilkis) via [PR #2157](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2157/)


0.130.0 - 2022-09-12
--------------------

Convert Tuple and Sequence types to GraphQL list types.

Example:

```python
from collections.abc import Sequence
from typing import Tuple

@strawberry.type
class User:
    pets: Sequence[Pet]
    favourite_ice_cream_flavours: Tuple[IceCreamFlavour]
```

Contributed by [Jonathan Kim](https://github.com/jkimbo) via [PR #2164](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2164/)


0.129.0 - 2022-09-11
--------------------

This release adds `strawberry.lazy` which allows you to define the type of the
field and its path. This is useful when you want to define a field with a type
that has a circular dependency.

For example, let's say we have a `User` type that has a list of `Post` and a
`Post` type that has a `User`:

```python
# posts.py
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Annotated

import strawberry

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from .users import User

@strawberry.type
class Post:
    title: str
    author: Annotated["User", strawberry.lazy(".users")]
```

```python
# users.py
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Annotated, List

import strawberry

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from .posts import Post

@strawberry.type
class User:
    name: str
    posts: List[Annotated["Post", strawberry.lazy(".posts")]]
```

Contributed by [Patrick Arminio](https://github.com/patrick91) via [PR #2158](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2158/)


0.128.0 - 2022-09-05
--------------------

This release changes how dataclasses are created to make use of the new
`kw_only` argument in Python 3.10 so that fields without a default value can now
follow a field with a default value. This feature is also backported to all other
supported Python versions.

More info: https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#dataclasses.dataclass

For example:

```python
# This no longer raises a TypeError

@strawberry.type
class MyType:
    a: str = "Hi"
    b: int
```

丘멆잺 This is a breaking change! Whenever instantiating a Strawberry type make sure
that you only pass values are keyword arguments:

```python
# Before:

MyType("foo", 3)

# After:

MyType(a="foo", b=3)
```

Contributed by [Jonathan Kim](https://github.com/jkimbo) via [PR #1187](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/1187/)


0.127.4 - 2022-08-31
--------------------

This release fixes a bug in the subscription clean up when subscribing using the
graphql-transport-ws protocol, which could occasionally cause a 'finally'
statement within the task to not get run, leading to leaked resources.

Contributed by [rjwills28](https://github.com/rjwills28) via [PR #2141](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2141/)


0.127.3 - 2022-08-30
--------------------

This release fixes a couple of small styling issues with
the GraphiQL explorer

Contributed by [Patrick Arminio](https://github.com/patrick91) via [PR #2143](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2143/)


0.127.2 - 2022-08-30
--------------------

This release adds support for passing schema directives to
`Schema(..., types=[])`. This can be useful if using a built-inschema directive
that's not supported by a gateway.

For example the following:

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry.scalars import JSON
from strawberry.schema_directive import Location


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    example: JSON


@strawberry.schema_directive(locations=[Location.SCALAR], name="specifiedBy")
class SpecifiedBy:
    name: str


schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query, types=[SpecifiedBy])
```

will print the following SDL:

```graphql
directive @specifiedBy(name: String!) on SCALAR

"""
The `JSON` scalar type represents JSON values as specified by [ECMA-404](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf).
"""
scalar JSON
  @specifiedBy(
    url: "http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf"
  )

type Query {
  example: JSON!
}
```

0.127.1 - 2022-08-30
--------------------

This release fixes an issue with the updated GraphiQL
interface.

Contributed by [Doctor](https://github.com/ThirVondukr) via [PR #2138](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2138/)


0.127.0 - 2022-08-29
--------------------

This release updates the built-in GraphiQL version to version 2.0,
which means you can now enjoy all the new features that come with the latest version!

Contributed by [Matt Exact](https://github.com/MattExact) via [PR #1889](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/1889/)


0.126.2 - 2022-08-23
--------------------

This release restricts the `backports.cached_property` dependency to only be
installed when Python < 3.8. Since version 3.8 `cached_property` is included
in the builtin `functools`. The code is updated to use the builtin version
when Python >= 3.8.

Contributed by [ljnsn](https://github.com/ljnsn) via [PR #2114](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2114/)


0.126.1 - 2022-08-22
--------------------

Keep extra discovered types sorted so that each schema printing is
always the same.

Contributed by [Thiago Bellini Ribeiro](https://github.com/bellini666) via [PR #2115](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2115/)


0.126.0 - 2022-08-18
--------------------

This release adds support for adding descriptions to enum values.

### Example


```python
@strawberry.enum
class IceCreamFlavour(Enum):
    VANILLA = strawberry.enum_value("vanilla")
    STRAWBERRY = strawberry.enum_value(
        "strawberry", description="Our favourite",
    )
    CHOCOLATE = "chocolate"


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    favorite_ice_cream: IceCreamFlavour = IceCreamFlavour.STRAWBERRY

schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query)
```

This produces the following schema

```graphql
enum IceCreamFlavour {
  VANILLA

  """Our favourite."""
  STRAWBERRY
  CHOCOLATE
}

type Query {
  favoriteIceCream: IceCreamFlavour!
}
```

0.125.1 - 2022-08-16
--------------------

This release hides `resolvable: True` in @keys directives
when using Apollo Federation 1, to preserve compatibility
with older Gateways.

Contributed by [Patrick Arminio](https://github.com/patrick91) via [PR #2099](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2099/)


0.125.0 - 2022-08-12
--------------------

This release adds an integration with Django Channels. The integration will
allow you to use GraphQL subscriptions via Django Channels.

Contributed by [Dan Sloan](https://github.com/LucidDan) via [PR #1407](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/1407/)


0.124.0 - 2022-08-08
--------------------

This release adds full support for Apollo Federation 2.0. To opt-in you need to
pass `enable_federation_2=True` to `strawberry.federation.Schema`, like in the
following example:

```python
@strawberry.federation.type(keys=["id"])
class User:
    id: strawberry.ID

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    user: User

schema = strawberry.federation.Schema(query=Query, enable_federation_2=True)
```

This release also improves type checker support for the federation.

0.123.3 - 2022-08-02
--------------------

This release fixes a regression introduced in version 0.118.2 which was
preventing using circular dependencies in Strawberry django and Strawberry
django plus.

Contributed by [Thiago Bellini Ribeiro](https://github.com/bellini666) via [PR #2062](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2062/)


0.123.2 - 2022-08-01
--------------------

This release adds support for priting custom enums used only on
schema directives, for example the following schema:

```python
@strawberry.enum
class Reason(str, Enum):
    EXAMPLE = "example"

@strawberry.schema_directive(locations=[Location.FIELD_DEFINITION])
class Sensitive:
    reason: Reason

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    first_name: str = strawberry.field(
        directives=[Sensitive(reason=Reason.EXAMPLE)]
    )
```

prints the following:

```graphql
directive @sensitive(reason: Reason!) on FIELD_DEFINITION

type Query {
    firstName: String! @sensitive(reason: EXAMPLE)
}

enum Reason {
    EXAMPLE
}
```

while previously it would omit the definition of the enum.

0.123.1 - 2022-08-01
--------------------

This release adds support for priting custom scalar used only on
schema directives, for example the following schema:

```python
SensitiveConfiguration = strawberry.scalar(str, name="SensitiveConfiguration")

@strawberry.schema_directive(locations=[Location.FIELD_DEFINITION])
class Sensitive:
    config: SensitiveConfiguration

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    first_name: str = strawberry.field(directives=[Sensitive(config="Some config")])
```

prints the following:

```graphql
directive @sensitive(config: SensitiveConfiguration!) on FIELD_DEFINITION

type Query {
    firstName: String! @sensitive(config: "Some config")
}

scalar SensitiveConfiguration
```

while previously it would omit the definition of the scalar.

0.123.0 - 2022-08-01
--------------------

This PR adds support for adding schema directives to the schema of
your GraphQL API. For printing the following schema:

```python
@strawberry.schema_directive(locations=[Location.SCHEMA])
class Tag:
    name: str

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    first_name: str = strawberry.field(directives=[Tag(name="team-1")])

schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query, schema_directives=[Tag(name="team-1")])
```

will print the following:

```graphql
directive @tag(name: String!) on SCHEMA

schema @tag(name: "team-1") {
    query: Query
}

type Query {
    firstName: String!
}
"""
```

0.122.1 - 2022-07-31
--------------------

This release fixes that the AIOHTTP integration ignored the `operationName` of query
operations. This behaviour is a regression introduced in version 0.107.0.

Contributed by [Jonathan Ehwald](https://github.com/DoctorJohn) via [PR #2055](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2055/)


0.122.0 - 2022-07-29
--------------------

This release adds support for printing default values for scalars like JSON.

For example the following:

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry.scalars import JSON


@strawberry.input
class MyInput:
    j: JSON = strawberry.field(default_factory=dict)
    j2: JSON = strawberry.field(default_factory=lambda: {"hello": "world"})
```

will print the following schema:

```graphql
input MyInput {
    j: JSON! = {}
    j2: JSON! = {hello: "world"}
}
```

0.121.1 - 2022-07-27
--------------------

This release adds a backward compatibility layer with libraries
that specify a custom `get_result`.

Contributed by [Patrick Arminio](https://github.com/patrick91) via [PR #2038](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2038/)


0.121.0 - 2022-07-23
--------------------

This release adds support for overriding the default resolver for fields.

Currently the default resolver is `getattr`, but now you can change it to any
function you like, for example you can allow returning dictionaries:

```python
@strawberry.type
class User:
    name: str

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def user(self) -> User:
        return {"name": "Patrick"}  # type: ignore

schema = strawberry.Schema(
    query=Query,
    config=StrawberryConfig(default_resolver=getitem),
)

query = "{ user { name } }"

result = schema.execute_sync(query)
```

0.120.0 - 2022-07-23
--------------------

This release add a new `DatadogTracingExtension` that can be used to instrument
your application with Datadog.

```python
import strawberry

from strawberry.extensions.tracing import DatadogTracingExtension

schema = strawberry.Schema(
    Query,
    extensions=[
        DatadogTracingExtension,
    ]
)
```

0.119.2 - 2022-07-23
--------------------

Fixed edge case where `Union` types raised an `UnallowedReturnTypeForUnion`
error when returning the correct type from the resolver. This also improves
performance of StrawberryUnion's `_resolve_union_type` from `O(n)` to `O(1)` in
the majority of cases where `n` is the number of types in the schema.

For
[example the below](https://play.strawberry.rocks/?gist=f7d88898d127e65b12140fdd763f9ef2))
would previously raise the error when querying `two` as `StrawberryUnion` would
incorrectly determine that the resolver returns `Container[TypeOne]`.

```python
import strawberry
from typing import TypeVar, Generic, Union, List, Type

T = TypeVar("T")

@strawberry.type
class Container(Generic[T]):
    items: List[T]

@strawberry.type
class TypeOne:
    attr: str

@strawberry.type
class TypeTwo:
    attr: str

def resolver_one():
    return Container(items=[TypeOne("one")])

def resolver_two():
    return Container(items=[TypeTwo("two")])

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    one: Union[Container[TypeOne], TypeOne] = strawberry.field(resolver_one)
    two: Union[Container[TypeTwo], TypeTwo] = strawberry.field(resolver_two)

schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query)

Contributed by [Dhanshree Arora](https://github.com/DhanshreeA) via [PR #2019](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2019/)


0.119.0 - 2022-07-14
--------------------

This release changes when we add the custom directives extension, previously
the extension was always enabled, now it is only enabled if you pass custom
directives to `strawberry.Schema`.

Contributed by [James Chua](https://github.com/thejaminator) via [PR #2016](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/2016/)


0.118.0 - 2022-07-13
--------------------

You can now pass keyword arguments to `to_pydantic`
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
import strawberry

class MyModel(BaseModel):
   email: str
   password: str


@strawberry.experimental.pydantic.input(model=MyModel)
class MyModelStrawberry:
   email: strawberry.auto
   # no password field here

MyModelStrawberry(email="").to_pydantic(password="hunter")
```

Also if you forget to pass password, mypy will complain

```python
MyModelStrawberry(email="").to_pydantic()
# error: Missing named argument "password" for "to_pydantic" of "MyModelStrawberry"

0.116.4 - 2022-07-04
--------------------

Fix regression caused by the new resolver argument handling mechanism
introduced in v0.115.0. This release restores the ability to use unhashable
default values in resolvers such as dict and list. See example below:

```python
@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def field(
        self, x: List[str] = ["foo"], y: JSON = {"foo": 42}  # noqa: B006
    ) -> str:
        return f"{x} {y}"

This release fixes a breaking internal error in mypy plugin for the following case.
- using positional arguments to pass a resolver for `strawberry.field()` or `strawberry.mutation()`

```python
failed: str = strawberry.field(resolver)
successed: str = strawberry.field(resolver=resolver)
```

now mypy returns an error with `"field()" or "mutation()" only takes keyword arguments` message
rather than an internal error.

0.116.0 - 2022-07-03
--------------------

This release adds a link from generated GraphQLCore types to the Strawberry type
that generated them.

From a GraphQLCore type you can now access the Strawberry type by doing:

```python
strawberry_type: TypeDefinition = graphql_core_type.extensions[GraphQLCoreConverter.DEFINITION_BACKREF]
```

0.115.0 - 2022-07-01
--------------------

This release changes how we declare the `info` argument in resolvers and the
`value` argument in directives.

Previously we'd use the name of the argument to determine its value. Now we use
the type annotation of the argument to determine its value.

Here's an example of how the old syntax works:

```python
def some_resolver(info) -> str:
    return info.context.get("some_key", "default")

@strawberry.type
class Example:
    a_field: str = strawberry.resolver(some_resolver)
```

and here's an example of how the new syntax works:

```python
from strawberry.types import Info

def some_resolver(info: Info) -> str:
    return info.context.get("some_key", "default")

@strawberry.type
class Example:
    a_field: str = strawberry.resolver(some_resolver)
```

This means that you can now use a different name for the `info` argument in your
resolver and the `value` argument in your directive.

Here's an example that uses a custom name for both the value and the info
parameter in directives:

```python
from strawberry.types import Info
from strawberry.directive import DirectiveLocation, DirectiveValue

@strawberry.type
class Cake:
    frosting: Optional[str] = None
    flavor: str = "Chocolate"

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def cake(self) -> Cake:
        return Cake()

@strawberry.directive(
    locations=[DirectiveLocation.FIELD],
    description="Add frosting with ``value`` to a cake.",
)
def add_frosting(value: str, v: DirectiveValue[Cake], my_info: Info):
    # Arbitrary argument name when using `DirectiveValue` is supported!
    assert isinstance(v, Cake)
    if value in my_info.context["allergies"]:  # Info can now be accessed from directives!
        raise AllergyError("You are allergic to this frosting!")
    else:
        v.frosting = value  # Value can now be used as a GraphQL argument name!
    return v
```

**Note:** the old way of passing arguments by name is deprecated and will be
removed in future releases of Strawberry.

0.114.7 - 2022-07-01
--------------------

Allow use of implicit `Any` in `strawberry.Private` annotated Generic types.

For example the following is now supported:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from typing import Generic, Sequence, TypeVar

import strawberry


T = TypeVar("T")


@strawberry.type
class Foo(Generic[T]):

    private_field: strawberry.Private[Sequence]  # instead of Sequence[Any]


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def foo(self) -> Foo[str]:
        return Foo(private_field=[1, 2, 3])
```

0.114.6 - 2022-06-30
--------------------

The federation decorator now allows for a list of additional arbitrary schema
directives extending the key/shareable directives used for federation.

Example Python:

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry.schema.config import StrawberryConfig
from strawberry.schema_directive import Location

@strawberry.schema_directive(locations=[Location.OBJECT])
class CacheControl:
    max_age: int

@strawberry.federation.type(
    keys=["id"], shareable=True, extend=True, directives=[CacheControl(max_age=42)]
)
class FederatedType:
    id: strawberry.ID

schema = strawberry.Schema(
    query=Query, config=StrawberryConfig(auto_camel_case=False)
)
```

Resulting GQL Schema:

```graphql
directive @CacheControl(max_age: Int!) on OBJECT
directive @key(fields: _FieldSet!, resolvable: Boolean) on OBJECT | INTERFACE
directive @shareable on FIELD_DEFINITION | OBJECT

extend type FederatedType
  @key(fields: "id")
  @shareable
  @CacheControl(max_age: 42) {
  id: ID!
}

type Query {
  federatedType: FederatedType!
}
```

0.114.5 - 2022-06-23
--------------------

This release adds support in Mypy for using strawberry.mutation
while passing a resolver, the following now doesn't make Mypy return
an error:

```python
import strawberry

def set_name(self, name: str) -> None:
    self.name = name

@strawberry.type
class Mutation:
    set_name: None = strawberry.mutation(resolver=set_name)

0.111.0 - 2022-05-02
--------------------

This release adds support for Apollo Federation 2 directives:
- @shareable
- @tag
- @override
- @inaccessible

This release does **not** add support for the @link directive.

This release updates the @key directive to align with Apollo Federation 2 updates.

See the below code snippet and/or the newly-added test cases for examples on how to use the new directives.
The below snippet demonstrates the @override directive.
```python
import strawberry
from typing import List

@strawberry.interface
class SomeInterface:
    id: strawberry.ID

@strawberry.federation.type(keys=["upc"], extend=True)
class Product(SomeInterface):
    upc: str = strawberry.federation.field(external=True, override=["mySubGraph"])

@strawberry.federation.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def top_products(self, first: int) -> List[Product]:
        return []

schema = strawberry.federation.Schema(query=Query)
```

should return:

```graphql
extend type Product implements SomeInterface @key(fields: "upc", resolvable: "True") {
  id: ID!
  upc: String! @external @override(from: "mySubGraph")
}

type Query {
  _service: _Service!
  _entities(representations: [_Any!]!): [_Entity]!
  topProducts(first: Int!): [Product!]!

from strawberry.arguments import is_unset  # old

a = UNSET

assert a is UNSET  # new
assert is_unset(a)  # old
```

0.106.1 - 2022-04-14
--------------------

This release fixes a number of problems with single-result-operations over
`graphql-transport-ws` protocol

- operation **IDs** now share the same namespace as streaming operations
  meaning that they cannot be reused while the others are in operation

- single-result-operations now run as *tasks* meaning that messages related
  to them can be overlapped with other messages on the websocket.

- single-result-operations can be cancelled with the `complete` message.

- IDs for single result and streaming result operations are now released
  once the operation is done, allowing them to be re-used later, as well as
  freeing up resources related to previous requests.

0.106.0 - 2022-04-14
--------------------

This release adds an implementation of the `GraphQLTestClient` for the `aiohttp` integration (in addition to the existing `asgi` and `Django` support). It hides the HTTP request's details and verifies that there are no errors in the response (this behavior can be disabled by passing `asserts_errors=False`). This makes it easier to test queries and makes your tests cleaner.

If you are using `pytest` you can add a fixture in `conftest.py`

```python
import pytest

from strawberry.aiohttp.test.client import GraphQLTestClient

@pytest.fixture
def graphql_client(aiohttp_client, myapp):
    yield GraphQLTestClient(aiohttp_client(myapp))
```

And use it everywhere in your tests

```python
def test_strawberry(graphql_client):
    query = """
        query Hi($name: String!) {
            hi(name: $name)
        }
    """

    result = graphql_client.query(query, variables={"name": "游꼡"})

    assert result.data == {"hi": "Hi 游꼡!"}

Forward references are supported as well:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from dataclasses import dataclass

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    private_foo: strawberry.Private[SensitiveData]

    @strawberry.field
    def foo(self) -> int:

This PR improves the support for scalars when using MyPy.

Contributed by [Patrick Arminio](https://github.com/patrick91) via [PR #1205](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/1205/)


0.102.0 - 2022-03-07
--------------------

Added the response object to `get_context` on the `flask` view. This means that in fields, something like this can be used;

```python
@strawberry.field
def response_check(self, info: Info) -> bool:
    response: Response = info.context["response"]
    response.status_code = 401

    return True
```

0.101.0 - 2022-03-06
--------------------

This release adds support for `graphql-transport-ws` single result operations.

Single result operations allow clients to execute queries and mutations over an existing WebSocket connection.

0.100.0 - 2022-03-05
--------------------

Change `strawberry.auto` to be a type instead of a sentinel.
This not only removes the dependency on sentinel from the project, but also fixes
some related issues, like the fact that only types can be used with `Annotated`.

Also, custom scalars will now trick static type checkers into thinking they
returned their wrapped type. This should fix issues with pyright 1.1.224+ where
it doesn't allow non-type objects to be used as annotations for dataclasses and
dataclass-alike classes (which is strawberry's case). The change to `strawberry.auto`
also fixes this issue for it.

0.98.2 - 2022-02-24
-------------------

Adds support for converting pydantic conlist.
Note that constraint is not enforced in the graphql type.
Thus, we recommend always working on the pydantic type such that the validation is enforced.

```python
import strawberry
from pydantic import BaseModel, conlist

class Example(BaseModel):
    friends: conlist(str, min_items=1)

@strawberry.experimental.pydantic.input(model=Example, all_fields=True)
class ExampleGQL:
    ...

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field()
    def test(self, example: ExampleGQL) -> None:
        # friends may be an empty list here
        print(example.friends)
        # calling to_pydantic() runs the validation and raises
        # an error if friends is empty
        print(example.to_pydantic().friends)

schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query)
```

The converted graphql type is
```
input ExampleGQL {
  friends: [String!]!
}
```

This release wasn't published on PyPI

0.98.0 - 2022-02-23
-------------------

This release updates `graphql-core` to `3.2.0`

Make sure you take a look at [`graphql-core`'s release notes](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-core/releases/tag/v3.2.0)

0.97.0 - 2022-02-17
-------------------

Support "void" functions

It is now possible to have a resolver that returns "None". Strawberry will automatically assign the new `Void` scalar in the schema
and will always send `null` in the response

## Exampe

```python
@strawberry.type
class Mutation:
    @strawberry.field
    def do_something(self, arg: int) -> None:
        return
```
results in this schema:
```grapqhl
type Mutation {
    doSomething(arg: Int!): Void
}
```

0.96.0 - 2022-02-07
-------------------

Add better support for custom Pydantic conversion logic and standardize the
behavior when not using `strawberry.auto` as the type.

See https://strawberry.rocks/docs/integrations/pydantic#custom-conversion-logic for details and examples.

Note that this release fixes a bug related to Pydantic aliases in schema
generation. If you have a field with the same name as an aliased Pydantic field
but with a different type than `strawberry.auto`, the generated field will now
use the alias name. This may cause schema changes on upgrade in these cases, so
care should be taken. The alias behavior can be disabled by setting the
`use_pydantic_alias` option of the decorator to false.

Contributed by [Matt Allen](https://github.com/Matt343) [PR #1629](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/1629/)


0.95.5 - 2022-02-07
-------------------

Adds support for `use_pydantic_alias` parameter in pydantic model conversion.
Decides if the all the GraphQL field names for the generated type should use the alias name or not.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
import strawberry

class UserModel(BaseModel):
      id: int = Field(..., alias="my_alias_name")

@strawberry.experimental.pydantic.type(
    UserModel, use_pydantic_alias=False
)
class User:
    id: strawberry.auto
```

If `use_pydantic_alias` is `False`, the GraphQL type User will use `id` for the name of the `id` field coming from the Pydantic model.
```
type User {
      id: Int!
}
```

With `use_pydantic_alias` set to `True` (the default behaviour) the GraphQL type user will use `myAliasName` for the `id` field coming from the Pydantic models (since the field has a `alias` specified`)
```
type User {
      myAliasName: Int!
}
```

`use_pydantic_alias` is set to `True` for backwards compatibility.

@strawberry.type
class Value(Generic[T]):

}

type IntStrDictItemListValue {
  value: [IntStrDictItem!]!
}

type Query {

0.93.23 - 2022-01-11
--------------------

Improve typing of `@strawberry.enum()` by:

1. Using a `TypeVar` bound on `EnumMeta` instead of `EnumMeta`, which allows
   type-checkers (like pyright) to detect the fields of the enum being
   decorated. For example, for the following enum:

```python
@strawberry.enum
class IceCreamFlavour(Enum):
    VANILLA = "vanilla"
    STRAWBERRY = "strawberry"
    CHOCOLATE = "chocolate"
```

Prior to this change, pyright would complain if you tried to access
`IceCreamFlavour.VANILLA`, since the type information of `IceCreamFlavour` was
being erased by the `EnumMeta` typing .

2. Overloading it so that type-checkers (like pyright) knows in what cases it
   returns a decorator (when it's called with keyword arguments, e.g.
   `@strawberry.enum(name="IceCreamFlavor")`), versus when it returns the
   original enum type (without keyword arguments.

--------------------

This release checks for AutoFieldsNotInBaseModelError when converting from pydantic models.
 It is raised when strawberry.auto is used, but the pydantic model does not have
the particular field defined.

```python
class User(BaseModel):
    age: int

@strawberry.experimental.pydantic.type(User)
class UserType:
    age: strawberry.auto
    password: strawberry.auto
```

Previously no errors would be raised, and the password field would not appear on graphql schema.
Such mistakes could be common during refactoring. Now, AutoFieldsNotInBaseModelError is raised.

0.92.1 - 2021-12-04

Fix cross-module type resolving for fields and resolvers

The following two issues are now fixed:

- A field with a generic (typeless) resolver looks up the
  type relative to the resolver and not the class the field is
  defined in. (#1448)

- When inheriting fields from another class the origin of the
  fields are set to the inheriting class and not the class the
  field is defined in.

Both these issues could lead to a rather undescriptive error message:

-------------------

This releases fixes an issue where you were not allowed
to return a non-strawberry type for fields that return

implementing the interface implements an `is_type_of`

0.91.0 - 2021-12-04
-------------------

This release adds a `GraphQLTestClient`. It hides the http request's details and asserts that there are no errors in the response (you can always disable this behavior by passing `asserts_errors=False`). This makes it easier to test queries and makes your tests cleaner.

If you are using `pytest` you can add a fixture in `conftest.py`

```python
import pytest

from django.test.client import Client

from strawberry.django.test import GraphQLTestClient


@pytest.fixture()
def graphql_client():
    yield GraphQLTestClient(Client())
```

And use it everywere in your test methods

```python
def test_strawberry(graphql_client):
    query = """
        query Hi($name: String!) {
            hi(name: $name)
        }
    """

    result = graphql_client.query(query, variables={"name": "Marcotte"})

    assert result.data == {"hi": "Hi Marcotte!"}
```

It can be used to test the file uploads as well

```python
from django.core.files.uploadedfile import SimpleUploadedFile


def test_upload(graphql_client):
    f = SimpleUploadedFile("file.txt", b"strawberry")
    query = """
        mutation($textFile: Upload!) {
            readText(textFile: $textFile)
        }
    """

    response = graphql_client.query(
        query=query,
        variables={"textFile": None},
        files={"textFile": f},
    )

    assert response.data["readText"] == "strawberry"

0.82.0 - 2021-10-11
-------------------

Adds support for the `auto` type annotation described in #1192 to the Pydantic
integration, which allows a user to define the list of fields without having to
re-specify the type themselves. This gives better editor and type checker
support. If you want to expose every field you can instead pass
`all_fields=True` to the decorators and leave the body empty.

```python
import pydantic
import strawberry
from strawberry.experimental.pydantic import auto

0.80.0 - 2021-09-30
-------------------

This release adds support for the `graphql-transport-ws` GraphQL over WebSocket
protocol. Previously Strawberry only supported the legacy `graphql-ws` protocol.

Developers can decide which protocols they want to accept. The following example shows
how to do so using the ASGI integration. By default, both protocols are accepted.
Take a look at our GraphQL subscription documentation to learn more.

0.78.0 - 2021-09-22
-------------------

This release introduces some brand new extensions to help improve the
performance of your GraphQL server:

* `ParserCache` - Cache the parsing of a query in memory
* `ValidationCache` - Cache the validation step of execution

For complicated queries these 2 extensions can improve performance by over 50%!

Example:

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry.extensions import ParserCache, ValidationCache

schema = strawberry.Schema(
  Query,
  extensions=[
    ParserCache(),
    ValidationCache(),
  ]
)
```

This release also removes the `validate_queries` and `validation_rules`
parameters on the `schema.execute*` methods in favour of using the
`DisableValidation` and `AddValidationRule` extensions.

Fix the Pydantic conversion method for Enum values, and add a mechanism to specify an interface type when converting from Pydantic. The Pydantic interface is really a base dataclass for the subclasses to extend. When you do the conversion, you have to use `strawberry.experimental.pydantic.interface` to let us know that this type is an interface. You also have to use your converted interface type as the base class for the sub types as normal.

0.75.0 - 2021-09-01
-------------------

This release improves how we deal with custom scalars. Instead of being global
they are now scoped to the schema. This allows you to have multiple schemas in
the same project with different scalars.

Also you can now override the built in scalars with your own custom
implementation. Out of the box Strawberry provides you with custom scalars for
common Python types like `datetime` and `Decimal`. If you require a custom
implementation of one of these built in scalars you can now pass a map of
overrides to your schema:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone
import strawberry

EpochDateTime = strawberry.scalar(
    datetime,
    serialize=lambda value: int(value.timestamp()),
    parse_value=lambda value: datetime.fromtimestamp(int(value), timezone.utc),
)

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def current_time(self) -> datetime:
        return datetime.now()

schema = strawberry.Schema(
  Query,
  scalar_overrides={
    datetime: EpochDateTime,
  }
)
result = schema.execute_sync("{ currentTime }")
assert result.data == {"currentTime": 1628683200}

0.73.2 - 2021-08-23
-------------------

This releases fixes an issue where you were not allowed
to use duck typing and return a different type that the
type declared on the field when the type was implementing
an interface. Now this works as long as you return a type
that has the same shape as the field type.

0.73.0 - 2021-08-22
-------------------

This release adds support for asynchronous hooks to the Strawberry extension-system.
All available hooks can now be implemented either synchronously or asynchronously.

It's also possible to mix both synchronous and asynchronous hooks within one extension.


```python
from strawberry.extensions import Extension

class MyExtension(Extension):
    async def on_request_start(self):
        print("GraphQL request start")

    def on_request_end(self):

0.69.0 - 2021-07-20
-------------------

Refactor of the library's typing internals. Previously, typing was handled
individually by fields, arguments, and objects with a hodgepodge of functions to tie it
together. This change creates a unified typing system that the object, fields, and
arguments each hook into.

Mainly replaces the attributes that were stored on StrawberryArgument and
StrawberryField with a hierarchy of StrawberryTypes.

Introduces `StrawberryAnnotation`, as well as `StrawberryType` and some subclasses,
including `StrawberryList`, `StrawberryOptional`, and `StrawberryTypeVar`.

This is a breaking change if you were calling the constructor for `StrawberryField`,
`StrawberryArgument`, etc. and using arguments such as `is_optional` or `child`.

`@strawberry.field` no longer takes an argument called `type_`. It instead takes a
`StrawberryAnnotation` called `type_annotation`.

New deployment process to release new Strawberry releases

[Marco Acierno](https://github.com/marcoacierno) [PR #957](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/957/)


0.63.0 - 2021-05-19
-------------------

This release adds extra values to the ExecutionContext object so that it can be
used by extensions and the `Schema.process_errors` function.

The full ExecutionContext object now looks like this:

```python
from graphql import ExecutionResult as GraphQLExecutionResult
from graphql.error.graphql_error import GraphQLError
from graphql.language import DocumentNode as GraphQLDocumentNode

@dataclasses.dataclass
class ExecutionContext:
    query: str
    context: Any = None
    variables: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    operation_name: Optional[str] = None

    graphql_document: Optional[GraphQLDocumentNode] = None
    errors: Optional[List[GraphQLError]] = None
    result: Optional[GraphQLExecutionResult] = None
```

and can be accessed in any of the extension hooks:

```python
from strawberry.extensions import Extension

class MyExtension(Extension):
    def on_request_end(self):
        result = self.execution_context.result
        # Do something with the result

schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query, extensions=[MyExtension])
```

---

Note: This release also removes the creation of an ExecutionContext object in the web
framework views. If you were relying on overriding the `get_execution_context`
function then you should change it to `get_request_data` and use the
`strawberry.http.parse_request_data` function to extract the pieces of data
needed from the incoming request.

0.62.1 - 2021-05-19
-------------------

This releases fixes an issue with the debug server that prevented the
usage of dataloaders, see: https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/issues/940

0.62.0 - 2021-05-19
-------------------

This release adds support for GraphQL subscriptions to the AIOHTTP integration.
Subscription support works out of the box and does not require any additional
configuration.

Here is an example how to get started with subscriptions in general. Note that by
specification GraphQL schemas must always define a query, even if only subscriptions
are used.

```python
import asyncio
import typing
import strawberry


@strawberry.type
class Subscription:
    @strawberry.subscription
    async def count(self, target: int = 100) -> typing.AsyncGenerator[int, None]:
        for i in range(target):
            yield i
            await asyncio.sleep(0.5)


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def _unused(self) -> str:
        return ""


schema = strawberry.Schema(subscription=Subscription, query=Query)
```

0.61.3 - 2021-05-13
-------------------

Fix `@requires(fields: ["email"])` and `@provides(fields: ["name"])` usage on a Federation field

You can use `@requires` to specify which fields you need to resolve a field

```python
import strawberry

@strawberry.federation.type(keys=["id"], extend=True)
class Product:
    id: strawberry.ID = strawberry.federation.field(external=True)
    code: str = strawberry.federation.field(external=True)

    @classmethod
    def resolve_reference(cls, id: strawberry.ID, code: str):
        return cls(id=id, code=code)

    @strawberry.federation.field(requires=["code"])
    def my_code(self) -> str:
        return self.code
```

`@provides` can be used to specify what fields are going to be resolved
by the service itself without having the Gateway to contact the external service
to resolve them.

0.61.2 - 2021-05-08
-------------------

This release adds support for the info param in resolve_reference:

```python
@strawberry.federation.type(keys=["upc"])
class Product:
    upc: str
    info: str

    @classmethod
    def resolve_reference(cls, info, upc):
        return Product(upc, info)
```

> Note: resolver reference is used when using Federation, similar to [Apollo server's __resolveReference](https://apollographql.com/docs/federation/api/apollo-federation/#__resolvereference)

0.61.1 - 2021-05-05
-------------------

This release extends the `strawberry server` command to allow the specification
of a schema symbol name within a module:

```sh
strawberry server mypackage.mymodule:myschema
```

The schema symbol name defaults to `schema` making this change backwards compatible.

0.61.0 - 2021-05-04
-------------------

This release adds file upload support to the [Sanic](https://sanicframework.org)
integration. No additional configuration is required to enable file upload support.

The following example shows how a file upload based mutation could look like:

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry.file_uploads import Upload


@strawberry.type
class Mutation:
    @strawberry.mutation
    def read_text(self, text_file: Upload) -> str:
        return text_file.read().decode()
```

0.60.0 - 2021-05-04
-------------------

This release adds an `export-schema` command to the Strawberry CLI.
Using the command you can print your schema definition to your console.
Pipes and redirection can be used to store the schema in a file.

Example usage:

```sh
strawberry export-schema mypackage.mymodule:myschema > schema.graphql
```

0.59.1 - 2021-05-04
-------------------

This release fixes an issue that prevented using `source` as name of an argument

0.59.0 - 2021-05-03
-------------------

This release adds an [aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) integration for
Strawberry. The integration provides a `GraphQLView` class which can be used to
integrate Strawberry with aiohttp:

```python
import strawberry
from aiohttp import web
from strawberry.aiohttp.views import GraphQLView


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    pass


schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query)

app = web.Application()

app.router.add_route("*", "/graphql", GraphQLView(schema=schema))
```

0.58.0 - 2021-05-03
-------------------

This release adds a function called `create_type` to create a Strawberry type from a list of fields.

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry.tools import create_type

@strawberry.field
def hello(info) -> str:
    return "World"

def get_name(info) -> str:
    return info.context.user.name

my_name = strawberry.field(name="myName", resolver=get_name)

Query = create_type("Query", [hello, my_name])

schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query)
```

0.57.4 - 2021-04-28
-------------------

This release fixes an issue when using nested lists, this now works properly:

```python
def get_polygons() -> List[List[float]]:
    return [[2.0, 6.0]]

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    polygons: List[List[float]] = strawberry.field(resolver=get_polygons)

schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query)

query = "{ polygons }"

result = schema.execute_sync(query, root_value=Query())
```

0.57.3 - 2021-04-27
-------------------

This release fixes support for generic types so that now we can also use generics for input types:

```python
T = typing.TypeVar("T")

@strawberry.input
class Input(typing.Generic[T]):
    field: T

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def field(self, input: Input[str]) -> str:
        return input.field
```

0.57.2 - 2021-04-19
-------------------

This release fixes a bug that prevented from extending a generic type when
passing a type, like here:

```python
T = typing.TypeVar("T")

@strawberry.interface
class Node(typing.Generic[T]):
    id: strawberry.ID

    def _resolve(self) -> typing.Optional[T]:
        return None

@strawberry.type
class Book(Node[str]):
    name: str

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def books(self) -> typing.List[Book]:
        return list()
```

0.57.1 - 2021-04-17
-------------------

Fix converting pydantic objects to strawberry types using `from_pydantic` when having a falsy value like 0 or ''.

0.57.0 - 2021-04-14
-------------------

Add a `process_errors` method to `strawberry.Schema` which logs all exceptions during execution to a `strawberry.execution` logger.

0.56.3 - 2021-04-13
-------------------

This release fixes the return type value from info argument of resolver.

0.56.2 - 2021-04-07
-------------------

This release improves Pydantic support to support default values and factories.

0.56.1 - 2021-04-06
-------------------

This release fixes the pydantic integration where you couldn't
convert objects to pydantic instance when they didn't have a
default value.

0.56.0 - 2021-04-05
-------------------

Add --app-dir CLI option to specify where to find the schema module to load when using
the debug server.

For example if you have a _schema_ module in a _my_app_ package under ./src, then you
can run the debug server with it using:

```bash
strawberry server --app-dir src my_app.schema
```

0.55.0 - 2021-04-05
-------------------

Add support for `default` and `default_factory` arguments in `strawberry.field`

```python
@strawberry.type
class Droid:
    name: str = strawberry.field(default="R2D2")
    aka: List[str] = strawberry.field(default_factory=lambda: ["Artoo"])
```

0.54.0 - 2021-04-03
-------------------

Internal refactoring.

* Renamed `StrawberryArgument` to `StrawberryArgumentAnnotation`
* Renamed `ArgumentDefinition` to `StrawberryArgument`
    * Renamed `ArgumentDefinition(type: ...)` argument to
      `StrawberryArgument(type_: ...)`

0.53.4 - 2021-04-03
-------------------

Fixed issue with django multipart/form-data uploads

0.53.3 - 2021-04-02
-------------------

Fix issue where StrawberryField.graphql_name would always be camelCased

0.53.2 - 2021-04-01
-------------------

This release fixes an issue with the generated `__eq__` and `__repr__` methods when defining
fields with resolvers.

This now works properly:

```python
@strawberry.type
class Query:
    a: int

    @strawberry.field
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "A"

assert Query(1) == Query(1)
assert Query(1) != Query(2)
```

0.53.1 - 2021-03-31
-------------------

Gracefully handle user-induced subscription errors.

0.53.0 - 2021-03-30
-------------------

* `FieldDefinition` has been absorbed into `StrawberryField` and now no longer exists.

* `FieldDefinition.origin_name` and `FieldDefinition.name`  have been replaced with
  `StrawberryField.python_name` and `StrawberryField.graphql_name`. This should help
  alleviate some backend confusion about which should be used for certain situations.

* `strawberry.types.type_resolver.resolve_type` has been split into
  `resolve_type_argument` and `_resolve_type` (for arguments) until `StrawberryType` is
  implemented to combine them back together. This was done to reduce the scope of this
  PR and defer changing `ArgumentDefinition` (future `StrawberryArgument`) until a
  different PR.

> Note: The constructor signature for `StrawberryField` has `type_` as an argument
> instead of `type` as was the case for `FieldDefinition`. This is done to prevent
> shadowing of builtins.

> Note: `StrawberryField.name` still exists because of the way dataclass `Field`s
work, but is an alias for `StrawberryField.python_name`.

0.52.1 - 2021-03-28
-------------------

Include `field_nodes` in Strawberry info object.

0.52.0 - 2021-03-23

    @strawberry.field
    def abc(self, info: Info) -> str:
        info.context.response.status_code = 418

        return "ABC"

`get_http_response` has been now removed from strawberry.asgi.http and been moved to be
a method on the ASGI class.

A new `get_graphiql_response` method has been added to make it easier to provide a different GraphiQL interface.

0.48.3 - 2021-03-11
-------------------

This release updates `get_context` in the asgi integration to also
receive a temporal response object that can be used to set headers

-------------------

Fix Generic name generation to use the custom name specified in Strawberry if available

```python
@strawberry.type(name="AnotherName")
class EdgeName:
    node: str

@strawberry.type
class Connection(Generic[T]):
    edge: T
```

will result in `AnotherNameConnection`, and not `EdgeNameConnection` as before.

0.45.0 - 2021-01-27
-------------------

This release add the ability to disable query validation by setting
`validate_queries` to `False`

```python
import strawberry

@strawberry.type
class Query:

Validate the schema when it is created instead of at runtime.

0.44.1 - 2020-11-20
-------------------

This release adds support for strawberry.federation.field under mypy.

0.44.0 - 2020-11-19
-------------------

Creation of a `[debug-server]` extra, which is required to get going quickly with this project!

```
pip install strawberry-graphql
```

Will now install the primary portion of of the framework, allowing you to build your GraphQL
schema using the dataclasses pattern.

To get going quickly, you can install `[debug-server]` which brings along a server which allows
you to develop your API dynamically, assuming your schema is defined in the `app` module:

```
pip install 'strawberry-graphql[debug-server]'
strawberry server app
```

Typically, in a production environment, you'd want to bring your own server :)

0.43.2 - 2020-11-19
-------------------

This release fixes an issue when using unions inside generic types, this is now
supported:


```python
@strawberry.type
class Dog:
    name: str

@strawberry.type
class Cat:
    name: str

@strawberry.type
class Connection(Generic[T]):
    nodes: List[T]

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    connection: Connection[Union[Dog, Cat]]
```

0.43.1 - 2020-11-18
-------------------

This releases fixes an issue with Strawberry requiring Pydantic even when not used.

0.43.0 - 2020-11-18
-------------------

This release adds support for creating types from Pydantic models. Here's an
example:

```python
import strawberry

from datetime import datetime
from typing import List, Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel


class UserModel(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name = 'John Doe'
    signup_ts: Optional[datetime] = None
    friends: List[int] = []

@strawberry.experimental.pydantic.type(model=UserModel, fields=[
    'id',
    'name',
    'friends'
])
class UserType:
    pass
```

0.42.7 - 2020-11-18
-------------------

Add some checks to make sure the types passed to `.union` are valid.

0.42.6 - 2020-11-18
-------------------

Fix issue preventing reusing the same resolver for multiple fields, like here:

```python
def get_name(self) -> str:
    return "Name"

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    name: str = strawberry.field(resolver=get_name)
    name_2: str = strawberry.field(resolver=get_name)
```

0.42.5 - 2020-11-18
-------------------

Another small improvement for mypy, this should prevent mypy from crashing when it can't find a type

0.42.4 - 2020-11-18
-------------------

This release fixes another issue with mypy where it wasn't able to identify strawberry fields.
It also now knows that fields with resolvers aren't put in the __init__ method of the class.

0.42.3 - 2020-11-17
-------------------

This release type improves support for strawberry.field in mypy,
now we don't get `Attributes without a default cannot follow attributes with one`
when using strawberry.field before a type without a default.

0.42.2 - 2020-11-17
-------------------

Bugfix to allow the use of `UNSET` as a default value for arguments.

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry.arguments import UNSET, is_unset

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def hello(self, name: Optional[str] = UNSET) -> str:
        if is_unset(name):
            return "Hi there"
        return "Hi {name}"

schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query)

result = schema.execute_async("{ hello }")
assert result.data == {"hello": "Hi there"}

result = schema.execute_async('{ hello(name: "Patrick" }')
assert result.data == {"hello": "Hi Patrick"}
```

SDL:

```graphql
type Query {
  hello(name: String): String!
}
```

0.42.1 - 2020-11-17
-------------------

This release improves mypy support for strawberry.field

0.42.0 - 2020-11-17
-------------------

* Completely revamped how resolvers are created, stored, and managed by
  StrawberryField. Now instead of monkeypatching a `FieldDefinition` object onto
  the resolver function itself, all resolvers are wrapped inside of a
  `StrawberryResolver` object with the useful properties.
* `arguments.get_arguments_from_resolver` is now the
  `StrawberryResolver.arguments` property
* Added a test to cover a situation where a field is added to a StrawberryType
  manually using `dataclasses.field` but not annotated. This was previously
  uncaught.

0.41.1 - 2020-11-14
-------------------

This release fixes an issue with forward types

0.41.0 - 2020-11-06
-------------------

This release adds a built-in dataloader. Example:

```python
async def app():
    async def idx(keys):
        return keys

    loader = DataLoader(load_fn=idx)

    [value_a, value_b, value_c] = await asyncio.gather(
        loader.load(1),
        loader.load(2),
        loader.load(3),
    )


    assert value_a == 1
    assert value_b == 2
    assert value_c == 3
```

0.40.2 - 2020-11-05
-------------------

Allow interfaces to implement other interfaces.
This may be useful if you are using the relay pattern
or if you want to model base interfaces that can be extended.

Example:
```python
import strawberry


@strawberry.interface
class Error:
    message: str

@strawberry.interface
class FieldError(Error):
    message: str
    field: str

@strawberry.type
class PasswordTooShort(FieldError):
    message: str
    field: str
    fix: str
```
Produces the following SDL:
```graphql
interface Error {
  message: String!
}

interface FieldError implements Error {
  message: String!
  field: String!
}

type PasswordTooShort implements FieldError & Error {
  message: String!
  field: String!
  fix: String!
}
```

0.40.1 - 2020-11-05
-------------------

Fix mypy plugin to handle bug where the `types` argument to `strawberry.union` is passed in as a keyword argument instead of a position one.

```python
MyUnion = strawberry.union(types=(TypeA, TypeB), name="MyUnion")
```

0.40.0 - 2020-11-03
-------------------

This release adds a new AsyncGraphQLView for django.

0.39.2 - 2020-10-29
-------------------

This fixes the prettier pre-lint check.

0.39.1 - 2020-10-28
-------------------

Fix issue when using `strawberry.enum(module.EnumClass)` in mypy

0.39.0 - 2020-10-27
-------------------

This release adds support to mark a field as deprecated via `deprecation_reason`

0.38.1 - 2020-10-27
-------------------

Set default value to null in the schema when it's set to None

0.38.0 - 2020-10-27
-------------------

Register UUID's as a custom scalar type instead of the ID type.

丘멆잺 This is a potential breaking change because inputs of type UUID are now parsed as instances of uuid.UUID instead of strings as they were before.

0.37.7 - 2020-10-27
-------------------

This release fixes a bug when returning list in async resolvers

0.37.6 - 2020-10-23
-------------------

This release improves how we check for enums

-------------------

This release fixes an issue preventing to return enums in lists

0.37.2 - 2020-10-21
-------------------

This release improves support for strawberry.enums when type checking with mypy.

0.37.1 - 2020-10-20
-------------------

Fix ASGI view to call `get_context` during a websocket request

0.37.0 - 2020-10-18
-------------------

Add support for adding a description to field arguments using the [`Annotated`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Annotated) type:

```python
from typing import Annotated

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def user_by_id(id: Annotated[str, strawberry.argument(description="The ID of the user")]) -> User:
        ...
```

which results in the following schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  userById(
    """The ID of the user"""
    id: String
  ): User!
}
```

**Note:** if you are not using Python v3.9 or greater you will need to import `Annotated` from `typing_extensions`

0.36.4 - 2020-10-17
-------------------

This release adds support for using strawberry.enum as a function with MyPy,
this is now valid typed code:

```python
from enum import Enum

import strawberry

class IceCreamFlavour(Enum):
    VANILLA = "vanilla"
    STRAWBERRY = "strawberry"
    CHOCOLATE = "chocolate"

Flavour = strawberry.enum(IceCreamFlavour)
```

0.36.3 - 2020-10-16
-------------------

Add `__str__` to `Schema` to allow printing schema sdl with `str(schema)`

0.36.2 - 2020-10-12
-------------------

Extend support for parsing isoformat datetimes,
adding a dependency on the `dateutil` library.
For example: "2020-10-12T22:00:00.000Z"
can now be parsed as a datetime with a UTC timezone.

0.36.1 - 2020-10-11
-------------------

Add `schema.introspect()` method to return introspection result of the schema.
This might be useful for tools like `apollo codegen` or `graphql-voyager` which
expect a full json representation of the schema

0.36.0 - 2020-10-06
-------------------

This releases adds a new extension for OpenTelemetry.

```python
import asyncio

from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import (
    ConsoleSpanExporter,
    SimpleExportSpanProcessor,
)

import strawberry
from strawberry.extensions.tracing import OpenTelemetryExtension


trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider())
trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(
    SimpleExportSpanProcessor(ConsoleSpanExporter())
)


@strawberry.type
class User:
    name: str


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    async def user(self, name: str) -> User:
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
        return User(name)


schema = strawberry.Schema(Query, extensions=[OpenTelemetryExtension])
```

0.35.5 - 2020-10-05
-------------------

This release disables tracing for default resolvers and introspection queries

0.35.4 - 2020-10-05

-------------------

This releases adds support for strawberry.union inside mypy.

0.35.2 - 2020-10-04
-------------------

This release fixes an issue with the extension runner and async resolvers

0.35.1 - 2020-10-02
-------------------

Fixed bug where you couldn't use the same Union type multiple times in a schema.

0.35.0 - 2020-10-02
-------------------

Added `strawberry.Private` type to mark fields as "private" so they don't show up in the GraphQL schema.

Example:

```python
import strawberry

@strawberry.type
class User:
    age: strawberry.Private[int]

    @strawberry.field
    def age_in_months(self) -> int:
        return self.age * 12
```

0.34.2 - 2020-10-01
-------------------

Fix typo in type_resolver.py

0.34.1 - 2020-09-30
-------------------

This release fixes an issue with mypy when doing the following:

```python
import strawberry

@strawberry.type
class User:
    name: str = strawberry.field(description='Example')
```

0.34.0 - 2020-09-30
-------------------

This release adds support for Apollo Tracing and support for creating Strawberry
extensions, here's how you can enable Apollo tracing:

```python
from strawberry.extensions.tracing import ApolloTracingExtension

schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query, extensions=[ApolloTracingExtension])
```

And here's an example of custom extension:

```python
from strawberry.extensions import Extension

class MyExtension(Extension):
    def get_results(self):
        return {
            "example": "this is an example for an extension"
        }

schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query, extensions=[MyExtension])
```

0.33.1 - 2020-09-25
-------------------

This release fixes an issue when trying to print a type
with a UNSET default value

0.33.0 - 2020-09-24
-------------------

* `UnionDefinition` has been renamed to `StrawberryUnion`
* `strawberry.union` now returns an instance of `StrawberryUnion` instead of a
dynamically generated class instance with a `_union_definition` attribute of
type `UnionDefinition`.

0.32.4 - 2020-09-22
-------------------

This release adds the `py.typed` file for better mypy support.

0.32.3 - 2020-09-07
-------------------

This release fixes another issue with extending types.

0.32.2 - 2020-09-07
-------------------

This releases fixes an issue when extending types, now
fields should work as they were working before even
when extending an existing type.

0.32.1 - 2020-09-06
-------------------

Improves tooling by adding `flake8-eradicate` to `flake8` `pre-commit` hook..

0.32.0 - 2020-09-06
-------------------

Previously, `strawberry.field` had redundant arguments for the resolver, one for
when `strawberry.field` was used as a decorator, and one for when it was used as
a function. These are now combined into a single argument.

The `f` argument of `strawberry.field` no longer exists. This is a
backwards-incompatible change, but should not affect many users. The `f`
argument was the first argument for `strawberry.field` and its use was only
documented without the keyword. The fix is very straight-forward: replace any
`f=` kwarg with `resolver=`.

```python
@strawberry.type
class Query:

    my_int: int = strawberry.field(f=lambda: 5)
    # becomes
    my_int: int = strawberry.field(resolver=lambda: 5)

    # no change
    @strawberry.field
    def my_float(self) -> float:
        return 5.5

```

Other (minor) breaking changes
* `MissingArgumentsAnnotationsError`'s message now uses the original Python
field name instead of the GraphQL field name. The error can only be thrown while
instantiating a strawberry.field, so the Python field name should be more
helpful.
* As a result, `strawberry.arguments.get_arguments_from_resolver()` now only
takes one field -- the `resolver` Callable.
* `MissingFieldAnnotationError` is now thrown when a strawberry.field is not
type-annotated but also has no resolver to determine its type

0.31.1 - 2020-08-26
-------------------

This release fixes the Flask view that was returning 400 when there were errors
in the GraphQL results. Now it always returns 200.

0.31.0 - 2020-08-26
-------------------

Add `process_result` to views for Django, Flask and ASGI. They can be overridden
to provide a custom response and also to process results and errors.

It also removes `request` from Flask view's `get_root_value` and `get_context`
since request in Flask is a global.

Django example:

```python
# views.py
from django.http import HttpRequest
from strawberry.django.views import GraphQLView as BaseGraphQLView
from strawberry.http import GraphQLHTTPResponse
from strawberry.types import ExecutionResult

class GraphQLView(BaseGraphQLView):
    def process_result(self, request: HttpRequest, result: ExecutionResult) -> GraphQLHTTPResponse:
        return {"data": result.data, "errors": result.errors or []}

```

Flask example:

```python
# views.py
from strawberry.flask.views import GraphQLView as BaseGraphQLView
from strawberry.http import GraphQLHTTPResponse
from strawberry.types import ExecutionResult

class GraphQLView(BaseGraphQLView):
    def process_result(self, result: ExecutionResult) -> GraphQLHTTPResponse:
        return {"data": result.data, "errors": result.errors or []}

```

ASGI example:

```python
from strawberry.asgi import GraphQL as BaseGraphQL
from strawberry.http import GraphQLHTTPResponse
from strawberry.types import ExecutionResult
from starlette.requests import Request

from .schema import schema

class GraphQL(BaseGraphQLView):
    async def process_result(self, request: Request, result: ExecutionResult) -> GraphQLHTTPResponse:
        return {"data": result.data, "errors": result.errors or []}

```

0.30.1 - 2020-08-17
-------------------

This releases fixes the check for unset values.

0.30.0 - 2020-08-16
-------------------

Add functions `get_root_value` and `get_context` to views for Django, Flask and
ASGI. They can be overridden to provide custom values per request.

Django example:

```python
# views.py
from strawberry.django.views import GraphQLView as BaseGraphQLView

class GraphQLView(BaseGraphQLView):
    def get_context(self, request):
        return {
            "request": request,
            "custom_context_value": "Hi!",
        }

    def get_root_value(self, request):
        return {
            "custom_root_value": "游꼡",
        }


# urls.py
from django.urls import path

from .views import GraphQLView
from .schema import schema

urlpatterns = [
    path("graphql/", GraphQLView.as_view(schema=schema)),
]
```

Flask example:

```python
# views.py
from strawberry.flask.views import GraphQLView as BaseGraphQLView

class GraphQLView(BaseGraphQLView):
    def get_context(self, request):
        return {
            "request": request,
            "custom_context_value": "Hi!",
        }

    def get_root_value(self, request):
        return {
            "custom_root_value": "游꼡",
        }


# app.py
from flask import Flask

from .views import GraphQLView
from .schema import schema

app = Flask(__name__)

app.add_url_rule(
    "/graphql",
    view_func=GraphQLView.as_view("graphql_view", schema=schema),
)
```


ASGI example:

```python
# app.py
from strawberry.asgi import GraphQL as BaseGraphQL

from .schema import schema

class GraphQL(BaseGraphQLView):
    async def get_context(self, request):
        return {
            "request": request,
            "custom_context_value": "Hi!",
        }

    async def get_root_value(self, request):
        return {
            "custom_root_value": "游꼡",
        }


app = GraphQL(schema)
```

0.29.1 - 2020-08-07
-------------------

Support for `default_value` on inputs.

Usage:
```python
class MyInput:
    s: Optional[str] = None
    i: int = 0
```
```graphql
input MyInput {
  s: String = null
  i: Int! = 0
}
```

0.29.0 - 2020-08-03
-------------------

This release adds support for file uploads within Django.

We follow the following spec: https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec


Example:

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry.file_uploads import Upload


@strawberry.type
class Mutation:
    @strawberry.mutation
    def read_text(self, text_file: Upload) -> str:
        return text_file.read().decode()
```

0.28.5 - 2020-08-01
-------------------

Fix issue when reusing an interface

0.28.4 - 2020-07-28
-------------------

Fix issue when using generic types with federation

0.28.3 - 2020-07-27

represented as GraphQL ID in the GraphQL schema.

0.28.1 - 2020-07-25
-------------------

This release fixes support for PEP-563, now you can safely use `from __future__ import annotations`,
like the following example:


```python
from __future__ import annotations

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    me: MyType = strawberry.field(name="myself")

@strawberry.type
class MyType:
    id: strawberry.ID

```

0.28.0 - 2020-07-24
-------------------

This releases brings a much needed internal refactor of how we generate
GraphQL types from class definitions. Hopefully this will make easier to
extend Strawberry in future.

There are some internal breaking changes, so if you encounter any issue
let us know and well try to help with the migration.

In addition to the internal refactor we also fixed some bugs and improved
the public api for the schema class. Now you can run queries directly
on the schema by running `schema.execute`, `schema.execute_sync` and
`schema.subscribe` on your schema.

    @strawberry.field
    def title(self) -> str:
        return f"Title for {self.id}"

    @classmethod
    def resolve_reference(cls, id):
        return Campaign(id)


@strawberry.federation.type(extend=True)
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def strawberry(self) -> str:
        return "游꼡"


schema = strawberry.federation.Schema(query=Query, types=[Campaign])
```

0.25.6 - 2020-05-19
-------------------

Default values make input arguments nullable when the default is None.
```python
class Query:
     @strawberry.field
     def hello(self, i: int = 0, s: str = None) -> str:
         return s
```
```graphql

```

This also improves the support for Union and Generic types, as it
was broken before.

0.24.1 - 2020-04-29
-------------------

This release fixes a bug introduced by 0.24.0

0.24.0 - 2020-04-29
-------------------

This releases allows to use resolver without having
to specify root and info arguments:

```python
def function_resolver() -> str:
    return "I'm a function resolver"

def function_resolver_with_params(x: str) -> str:
    return f"I'm {x}"

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    hello: str = strawberry.field(resolver=function_resolver)
    hello_with_params: str = strawberry.field(
        resolver=function_resolver_with_params
    )


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def hello(self) -> str:
        return "I'm a function resolver"

    @strawberry.field
    def hello_with_params(self, x: str) -> str:

to reuse types, here's an example:

```python
T = typing.TypeVar("T")

@strawberry.type
class Edge(typing.Generic[T]):
    cursor: strawberry.ID
    node: T

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field

app = Flask(__name__)

app.add_url_rule(
    "/graphql", view_func=GraphQLView.as_view("graphql_view", schema=schema)
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

0.20.3 - 2020-02-11
-------------------

Improve datetime, date and time types conversion. Removes aniso dependency

This release improves support for permissions (it is a breaking change).
Now you will receive the source and the arguments in the `has_permission` method,
so you can run more complex permission checks. It also allows to use permissions
on fields, here's an example:


```python
import strawberry

from strawberry.permission import BasePermission

class IsAdmin(BasePermission):
    message = "You are not authorized"

    def has_permission(self, source, info):
      return source.name.lower() == "Patrick" or _is_admin(info)


@strawberry.type
class User:
    name: str
    email: str = strawberry.field(permission_classes=[IsAdmin])


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field(permission_classes=[IsAdmin])
    def user(self, info) -> str:
      return User(name="Patrick", email="example@email.com")
```

-------------------

This release improves support for django and asgi integration.

It allows to use async resolvers when using django. It also changes the status
code from 400 to 200 even if there are errors this makes it possible to still
use other fields even if one raised an error.

We also moved strawberry.contrib.django to strawberry.django, so if you're using
the django view make sure you update the paths.

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry.directive import DirectiveLocation

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    cake: str = "made_in_switzerland"

@strawberry.directive(
