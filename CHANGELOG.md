CHANGELOG
=========

0.226.0 - 2024-04-17
--------------------

Starting with this release, any error raised from within schema
extensions will abort the operation and is returned to the client.

This corresponds to the way we already handle field extension errors
and resolver errors.

This is particular useful for schema extensions performing checks early
in the request lifecycle, for example:

```python
class MaxQueryLengthExtension(SchemaExtension):
    MAX_QUERY_LENGTH = 8192

    async def on_operation(self):
        if len(self.execution_context.query) > self.MAX_QUERY_LENGTH:
            raise StrawberryGraphQLError(message="Query too large")
        yield
```

This change fixes GET request queries returning a 400 if a content_type header is supplied

Contributed by [Nathan John](https://github.com/vethan) via [PR #3452](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/3452/)


0.225.0 - 2024-04-14
--------------------

This release adds support for using FastAPI APIRouter arguments in GraphQLRouter.

Now you have the opportunity to specify parameters such as `tags`, `route_class`,
`deprecated`, `include_in_schema`, etc:

```python
import strawberry

from fastapi import FastAPI
from strawberry.fastapi import GraphQLRouter


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def hello(self) -> str:
        return "Hello World"


schema = strawberry.Schema(Query)

graphql_app = GraphQLRouter(schema, tags=["graphql"])

app = FastAPI()
app.include_router(graphql_app, prefix="/graphql")
```

0.223.0 - 2024-03-29
--------------------

This release adds support for Apollo Federation in the schema codegen. Now you
can convert a schema like this:

```graphql
extend schema
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.3",
        import: ["@key", "@shareable"])

type Query {
  me: User
}

type User @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  username: String! @shareable
}
```

to a Strawberry powered schema like this:

```python
import strawberry


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    me: User | None


@strawberry.federation.type(keys=["id"])
class User:
    id: strawberry.ID
    username: str = strawberry.federation.field(shareable=True)


schema = strawberry.federation.Schema(query=Query, enable_federation_2=True)
```

By running the following command:

```bash

0.222.0 - 2024-03-27
--------------------

This release adds support for Apollo Federation v2.7 which includes the `@authenticated`, `@requiresScopes`, `@policy` directives, as well as the `label` argument for `@override`.
As usual, we have first class support for them in the `strawberry.federation` namespace, here's an example:

```python
from strawberry.federation.schema_directives import Override


@strawberry.federation.type(
    authenticated=True,
    policy=[["client", "poweruser"], ["admin"]],
    requires_scopes=[["client", "poweruser"], ["admin"]],
)
class Product:
    upc: str = strawberry.federation.field(
        override=Override(override_from="mySubGraph", label="percent(1)")
    )
```

0.221.1 - 2024-03-21
--------------------

This release properly allows passing one argument to the `Info` class.

This is now fully supported:

```python
import strawberry

from typing import TypedDict


class Context(TypedDict):
    user_id: str


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def info(self, info: strawberry.Info[Context]) -> str:
        return info.context["user_id"]
```

Contributed by [Patrick Arminio](https://github.com/patrick91) via [PR #3419](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/3419/)


0.221.0 - 2024-03-21
--------------------

This release improves the `Info` type, by adding support for default TypeVars
and by exporting it from the main module. This makes it easier to use `Info` in
your own code, without having to import it from `strawberry.types.info`.

### New export

By exporting `Info` from the main module, now you can do the follwing:

```python
import strawberry


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def info(self, info: strawberry.Info) -> str:
        # do something with info
        return "hello"
```

### Default TypeVars

The `Info` type now has default TypeVars, so you can use it without having to
specify the type arguments, like we did in the example above. Make sure to use
the latest version of Mypy or Pyright for this. It also means that you can only
pass one value to it if you only care about the context type:

```python
import strawberry

from .context import Context


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def info(self, info: strawberry.Info[Context]) -> str:
        return info.context.user_id
```

0.220.0 - 2024-03-08
--------------------

This release adds support to allow passing `connection_params` as dictionary to `GraphQLWebsocketCommunicator` class when testing [channels integration](https://strawberry.rocks/docs/integrations/channels#testing)


### Example


```python
GraphQLWebsocketCommunicator(
    application=application,
    path="/graphql",
    connection_params={"username": "strawberry"},
)
```

0.219.2 - 2024-02-06
--------------------

This releases updates the dependency of `python-multipart` to be at least `0.0.7` (which includes a security fix).

It also removes the upper bound for `python-multipart` so you can always install the latest version (if compatible) 😊

- Add extra PR requirement in README.md

Contributed by [SD](https://github.com/sdobbelaere) via [PR #3361](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/3361/)


0.219.0 - 2024-01-24
--------------------

This release adds support for [litestar](https://litestar.dev/).

```python
import strawberry
from litestar import Request, Litestar
from strawberry.litestar import make_graphql_controller
from strawberry.types.info import Info


def custom_context_getter(request: Request):
    return {"custom": "context"}


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def hello(self, info: strawberry.Info[object, None]) -> str:
        return info.context["custom"]


schema = strawberry.Schema(Query)


GraphQLController = make_graphql_controller(
    schema,
    path="/graphql",
    context_getter=custom_context_getter,
)

app = Litestar(
    route_handlers=[GraphQLController],
)
```

0.218.1 - 2024-01-23
--------------------

This release fixes a small issue in the GraphQL Transport websocket
where the connection would fail when receiving extra parameters
in the payload sent from the client.

This would happen when using Apollo Sandbox.

Contributed by [Patrick Arminio](https://github.com/patrick91) via [PR #3356](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/3356/)


0.218.0 - 2024-01-22
--------------------

This release adds a new method `get_fields` on the `Schema` class.
You can use `get_fields` to hide certain field based on some conditions,
for example:

```python
@strawberry.type
class User:
    name: str
    email: str = strawberry.field(metadata={"tags": ["internal"]})


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    user: User


def public_field_filter(field: StrawberryField) -> bool:
    return "internal" not in field.metadata.get("tags", [])


class PublicSchema(strawberry.Schema):
    def get_fields(
        self, type_definition: StrawberryObjectDefinition
    ) -> List[StrawberryField]:
        return list(filter(public_field_filter, type_definition.fields))


schema = PublicSchema(query=Query)
```

The schema here would only have the `name` field on the `User` type.

0.217.1 - 2024-01-04
--------------------

This hotfix enables permission extensions to be used with AsyncGenerators.

Contributed by [Erik Wrede](https://github.com/erikwrede) via [PR #3318](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/3318/)


0.217.0 - 2023-12-18
--------------------

Permissions classes now use a `FieldExtension`. The new preferred way to add permissions
is to use the `PermissionsExtension` class:

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry.permission import PermissionExtension, BasePermission


class IsAuthorized(BasePermission):
    message = "User is not authorized"
    error_extensions = {"code": "UNAUTHORIZED"}

    def has_permission(self, source, info, **kwargs) -> bool:
        return False


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field(extensions=[PermissionExtension(permissions=[IsAuthorized()])])
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "ABC"
```

The old way of adding permissions using `permission_classes` is still
supported via the automatic addition of a `PermissionExtension` on the field.

### ⚠️ Breaking changes

Previously the `kwargs` argument keys for the `has_permission` method were
using camel casing (depending on your schema configuration), now they will
always follow the python name defined in your resolvers.

```python
class IsAuthorized(BasePermission):
    message = "User is not authorized"

    def has_permission(
        self, source, info, **kwargs: typing.Any
    ) -> bool:  # pragma: no cover
        # kwargs will have a key called "a_key"
        # instead of `aKey`

        return False


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field(permission_classes=[IsAuthorized])
    def name(self, a_key: str) -> str:  # pragma: no cover
        return "Erik"
```

Using the new `PermissionExtension` API, permissions support even more features:

#### Silent errors

To return `None` or `[]` instead of raising an error, the `fail_silently ` keyword
argument on `PermissionExtension` can be set to `True`.

#### Custom Error Extensions & classes

Permissions will now automatically add pre-defined error extensions to the error, and
can use a custom `GraphQLError` class. This can be configured by modifying
the  `error_class` and `error_extensions` attributes on the `BasePermission` class.

#### Customizable Error Handling

To customize the error handling, the `on_unauthorized` method on
the `BasePermission` class can be used. Further changes can be implemented by
subclassing the `PermissionExtension` class.

#### Schema Directives

Permissions will automatically be added as schema directives to the schema. This
behavior can be altered by setting the `add_directives` to `False`
on `PermissionExtension`, or by setting the `_schema_directive` class attribute of the
permission to a custom directive.

0.213.0 - 2023-11-08
--------------------

This release adds support in _all_ all our HTTP integration for choosing between
different GraphQL IDEs. For now we support [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) (the default),
[Apollo Sandbox](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/explorer/sandbox/), and [Pathfinder](https://pathfinder.dev/).

**Deprecations:** This release deprecates the `graphiql` option in all HTTP integrations,
in favour of `graphql_ide`, this allows us to only have one settings to change GraphQL ide,
or to disable it.

Here's a couple of examples of how you can use this:

### FastAPI

```python
import strawberry

from fastapi import FastAPI
from strawberry.fastapi import GraphQLRouter
from api.schema import schema

graphql_app = GraphQLRouter(schema, graphql_ide="apollo-sandbox")

app = FastAPI()
app.include_router(graphql_app, prefix="/graphql")
```

### Django

```python
from django.urls import path

from strawberry.django.views import GraphQLView

from api.schema import schema

urlpatterns = [
    path("graphql/", GraphQLView.as_view(schema=schema, graphql_ide="pathfinder")),
]
```

0.212.0 - 2023-11-07
--------------------

This release changes how we check for generic types. Previously, any type that
had a generic typevar would be considered generic for the GraphQL schema, this
would generate un-necessary types in some cases. Now, we only consider a type
generic if it has a typevar that is used as the type of a field or one of its arguments.

For example the following type:

```python
@strawberry.type
class Edge[T]:
    cursor: strawberry.ID
    some_interna_value: strawberry.Private[T]
```

Will not generate a generic type in the schema, as the typevar `T` is not used
as the type of a field or argument.

0.211.1 - 2023-10-25
--------------------

This release fixes an issue that prevented the `parser_cache` extension to be used in combination with
other extensions such as `MaxTokensLimiter`.

The following should work as expected now:

```python
schema = strawberry.Schema(
    query=Query, extensions=[MaxTokensLimiter(max_token_count=20), ParserCache()]
)
```

0.210.0 - 2023-10-24
--------------------

This release deprecates our `SentryTracingExtension`, as it is now incorporated directly into Sentry itself as of [version 1.32.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/releases/tag/1.32.0). You can now directly instrument Strawberry with Sentry.

Below is the revised usage example:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.strawberry import StrawberryIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[
        # make sure to set async_execution to False if you're executing
        # GraphQL queries synchronously
        StrawberryIntegration(async_execution=True),
    ],
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)
```

0.209.4 - 2023-10-02
--------------------

This release changes how we check for conflicting resolver arguments to
exclude `self` from those checks, which were introduced on version 0.208.0.

It is a common pattern among integrations, such as the Django one, to
use `root: Model` in the resolvers for better typing inference.

```graphql
type Query {
  user: User
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!

import strawberry

T = TypeVar("T")


@strawberry.type
class Connection(Generic[T]):
    nodes: list[T]


@strawberry.type
class Entity1:

The current version of the code generator is not able to handle the `...PartialBogPost` in this position because it assumes it can only find `Field` type nodes even though the spread should be legit.

0.206.0 - 2023-09-13
--------------------

`strawberry codegen` can now operate on multiple input query files.
The previous behavior of naming the file `types.js` and `types.py`
for the builtin `typescript` and `python` plugins respectively is
preserved, but only if a single query file is passed.  When more
than one query file is passed, the code generator will now use
the stem of the query file's name to construct the name of the
output files.  e.g. `my_query.graphql` -> `my_query.js` or
`my_query.py`.  Creators of custom plugins are responsible
for controlling the name of the output file themselves.  To
accomodate this, if the `__init__` method of a `QueryCodegenPlugin`
has a parameter named `query` or `query_file`, the `pathlib.Path`
to the query file will be passed to the plugin's `__init__`
method.

Finally, the `ConsolePlugin` has also recieved two new lifecycle
methods.  Unlike other `QueryCodegenPlugin`, the same instance of
the `ConsolePlugin` is used for each query file processed.  This
allows it to keep state around how many total files were processed.
The `ConsolePlugin` recieved two new lifecycle hooks: `before_any_start`
and `after_all_finished` that get called at the appropriate times.

0.205.0 - 2023-08-24
--------------------

`strawberry codegen` previously choked for inputs that used the
`strawberry.UNSET` sentinal singleton value as a default.  The intent
here is to say that if a variable is not part of the request payload,
then the `UNSET` default value will not be modified and the service
code can then treat an unset value differently from a default value,
etc.

For codegen, we treat the `UNSET` default value as a `GraphQLNullValue`.
The `.value` property is the `UNSET` object in this case (instead of
the usual `None`).  In the built-in python code generator, this causes
the client to generate an object with a `None` default.  Custom client
generators can sniff at this value and update their behavior.

0.203.2 - 2023-08-14
--------------------

Enhancements:
- Improved pydantic conversion compatibility with specialized list classes.
  - Modified `StrawberryAnnotation._is_list` to check if the `annotation` extends from the `list` type, enabling it to be considered a list.
  - in `StrawberryAnnotation` Moved the `_is_list` check before the `_is_generic` check in `resolve` to avoid `unsupported` error in `_is_generic` before it checked `_is_list`.

This enhancement enables the usage of constrained lists as class types and allows the creation of specialized lists. The following example demonstrates this feature:

```python
import strawberry
from pydantic import BaseModel, ConstrainedList


class FriendList(ConstrainedList):
    min_items = 1


class UserModel(BaseModel):
    age: int
    friend_names: FriendList[str]


@strawberry.experimental.pydantic.type(UserModel)
class User:
    age: strawberry.auto

it was expected the string to be splited in 2 parts when doing `.split(":")`.

Now we are using `.split(":", 1)`, meaning that the example above will consider
`SomeType` to be the type name, and `some:value` to be the node_id.

0.196.2 - 2023-07-28
--------------------

This release fixes an issue when trying to use `Annotated[strawberry.auto, ...]`
on python 3.10 or older, which got evident after the fix from 0.196.1.

Previously we were throwing the type away, since it usually is `Any`, but python
3.10 and older will validate that the first argument passed for `Annotated`
is callable (3.11+ does not do that anymore), and `StrawberryAuto` is not.

This changes it to keep that `Any`, which is also what someone would expect
when resolving the annotation using our custom `eval_type` function.

0.195.0 - 2023-07-14
--------------------

Improve the time complexity of `strawberry.interface` using `resolve_type`.
Achieved time complexity is now O(1) with respect to the number of
implementations of an interface. Previously, the use of `is_type_of` resulted
in a worst-case performance of O(n).

0.194.0 - 2023-07-08
--------------------

Restore evaled type access in `StrawberryAnnotation`

Prior to Strawberry 192.2 the `annotation` attribute of `StrawberryAnnotation`
would return an evaluated type when possible due reserved argument parsing.
192.2 moved the responsibility of evaluating and caching results to the
`evaluate` method of `StrawberryAnnotation`. This introduced a regression when
using future annotations for any code implicitely relying on the `annotation`
attribute being an evaluated type.

To fix this regression and mimick pre-192.2 behavior, this release adds an
`annotation` property to `StrawberryAnnotation` that internally calls the
`evaluate` method. On success the evaluated type is returned. If a `NameError`
is raised due to an unresolvable annotation, the raw annotation is returned.

0.193.0 - 2023-07-04
--------------------

This release updates the API to listen to Django Channels to avoid race conditions
when confirming GraphQL subscriptions.

**Deprecations:**

This release contains a deprecation for the Channels integration. The `channel_listen`
method will be replaced with an async context manager that returns an awaitable
AsyncGenerator. This method is called `listen_to_channel`.

An example of migrating existing code is given below:

```py
# Existing code
@strawberry.type
class MyDataType:
    name: str


@strawberry.type
class Subscription:
    @strawberry.subscription
    async def my_data_subscription(
        self, info: strawberry.Info, groups: list[str]
    ) -> AsyncGenerator[MyDataType | None, None]:
        yield None
        async for message in info.context["ws"].channel_listen(
            "my_data", groups=groups
        ):
            yield MyDataType(name=message["payload"])
```

```py
# New code
@strawberry.type
class Subscription:
    @strawberry.subscription
    async def my_data_subscription(
        self, info: strawberry.Info, groups: list[str]
    ) -> AsyncGenerator[MyDataType | None, None]:
        async with info.context["ws"].listen_to_channel("my_data", groups=groups) as cm:
            yield None
            async for message in cm:
                yield MyDataType(name=message["payload"])
```

0.192.2 - 2023-07-03
--------------------

This release fixes an issue related to using `typing.Annotated` in resolver
arguments following the declaration of a reserved argument such as
`strawberry.types.Info`.

Before this fix, the following would be converted incorrectly:

```python
from __future__ import annotations
import strawberry
import uuid
from typing_extensions import Annotated
from strawberry.types import Info


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def get_testing(
        self,
        info: strawberry.Info,
        id_: Annotated[uuid.UUID, strawberry.argument(name="id")],
    ) -> str | None:
        return None


schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query)

print(schema)
```

Resulting in the schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  getTesting(id_: UUID!): String # ⬅️ see `id_`
}

scalar UUID
```

After this fix, the schema is converted correctly:

```graphql
type Query {
  getTesting(id: UUID!): String
}

scalar UUID
```

This release introduces a new command called `upgrade`, this command can be used
to run codemods on your codebase to upgrade to the latest version of Strawberry.

At the moment we only support upgrading unions to use the new syntax with
annotated, but in future we plan to add more commands to help with upgrading.

Here's how you can use the command to upgrade your codebase:

```shell
strawberry upgrade annotated-union .
```

0.191.0 - 2023-06-28
--------------------

This release adds support for declaring union types using `typing.Annotated`
instead of `strawberry.union(name, types=...)`.

Code using the old syntax will continue to work, but it will trigger a
deprecation warning. Using Annotated will improve type checking and IDE support
especially when using `pyright`.

Before:

```python
Animal = strawberry.union("Animal", (Cat, Dog))
```

After:

```python
from typing import Annotated, Union

Animal = Annotated[Union[Cat, Dog], strawberry.union("Animal")]
```

0.190.0 - 2023-06-27
--------------------

This release refactors the way we resolve field types to to make it

0.183.4 - 2023-06-07
--------------------

This release fixes an issue for parsing lazy types using forward references
when they were enclosed in an `Optional[...]` type.

The following now should work properly:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from typing import Optional, Annotated
import strawberry


@strawberry.type
class MyType:
    other_type: Optional[Annotated["OtherType", strawberry.lazy("some.module")]]

0.183.1 - 2023-06-06
--------------------

This release fixes an issue of the new relay integration adding an `id: GlobalID!`
argument on all objects that inherit from `relay.Node`. That should've only happened
for `Query` types.

Strawberry now will not force a `relay.Node` or any type that inherits it to be
inject the node extension which adds the argument and a resolver for it, meaning that
this code:

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry import relay


@strawberry.type
class Fruit(relay.Node):
    id: relay.NodeID[int]


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    node: relay.Node
    fruit: Fruit
```

Should now be written as:

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry import relay


@strawberry.type
class Fruit(relay.Node):
    id: relay.NodeID[int]


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    node: relay.Node = relay.node()  # <- note the "= relay.node()" here
    fruit: Fruit = relay.node()
```

0.183.0 - 2023-06-06
--------------------

This release adds a new field extension called `InputMutationExtension`, which makes
it easier to create mutations that receive a single input type called `input`,
while still being able to define the arguments of that input on the resolver itself.

The following example:

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry.field_extensions import InputMutationExtension


@strawberry.type
class Fruit:
    id: strawberry.ID
    name: str
    weight: float


@strawberry.type
class Mutation:
    @strawberry.mutation(extensions=[InputMutationExtension()])
    def update_fruit_weight(
        self,
        info: strawberry.Info,
        id: strawberry.ID,
        weight: Annotated[
            float,
            strawberry.argument(description="The fruit's new weight in grams"),
        ],
    ) -> Fruit:
        fruit = ...  # retrieve the fruit with the given ID
        fruit.weight = weight
        ...  # maybe save the fruit in the database
        return fruit
```

Would generate a schema like this:

```graphql
input UpdateFruitInput {
  id: ID!

  """
  The fruit's new weight in grams
  """
  weight: Float!
}

type Fruit {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  weight: Float!
}

type Mutation {
  updateFruitWeight(input: UpdateFruitInput!): Fruit!
}
```

0.180.2 - 2023-06-02
--------------------

In this release codegen no longer chokes on queries that use a fragment.

There is one significant limitation at the present.  When a fragment is included via the spread operator in an object, it must be the only field present.  Attempts to include more fields will result in a ``ValueError``.

However, there are some real benefits.  When a fragment is included in multiple places in the query, only a single class will be made to represent that fragment:

```
fragment Point on Bar {
   id
   x
   y
}

query GetPoints {
  circlePoints {
    ...Point
  }
  squarePoints {
    ...Point
  }
}
```

Might generate the following types

```py
class Point:
    id: str
    x: float
    y: float


class GetPointsResult:
    circle_points: List[Point]
    square_points: List[Point]
```

The previous behavior would generate duplicate classes for for the `GetPointsCirclePoints` and `GetPointsSquarePoints` even though they are really identical classes.

0.180.0 - 2023-05-31
--------------------

This release updates the Django Channels integration so that it uses the same base
classes used by all other integrations.

**New features:**

The Django Channels integration supports two new features:

* Setting headers in a response
* File uploads via `multipart/form-data` POST requests

**Breaking changes:**

This release contains a breaking change for the Channels integration. The context
object is now a `dict` and it contains different keys depending on the connection
protocol:

1. HTTP: `request` and `response`. The `request` object contains the full
   request (including the body). Previously, `request` was the `GraphQLHTTPConsumer`
   instance of the current connection. The consumer is now available via
   `request.consumer`.
2. WebSockets: `request`, `ws` and `response`. `request` and `ws` are the same
   `GraphQLWSConsumer` instance of the current connection.

If you want to use a dataclass for the context object (like in previous releases),
you can still use them by overriding the `get_context` methods. See the Channels
integration documentation for an example.

--------------------

This release fixes a bug in experimental.pydantic whereby `Optional` type annotations weren't exactly aligned between strawberry type and pydantic model.

0.178.0 - 2023-05-22
--------------------

This release introduces the new `should_ignore` argument to the `QueryDepthLimiter` extension that provides
a more general and more verbose way of specifying the rules by which a query's depth should be limited.

The `should_ignore` argument should be a function that accepts a single argument of type `IgnoreContext`.
The `IgnoreContext` class has the following attributes:
- `field_name` of type `str`: the name of the field to be compared against
- `field_args` of type `strawberry.extensions.query_depth_limiter.FieldArgumentsType`: the arguments of the field to be compared against
- `query` of type `graphql.language.Node`: the query string
- `context` of type `graphql.validation.ValidationContext`: the context passed to the query
and returns `True` if the field should be ignored and `False` otherwise.
This argument is injected, regardless of name, by the `QueryDepthLimiter` class and should not be passed by the user.

Instead, the user should write business logic to determine whether a field should be ignored or not by
the attributes of the `IgnoreContext` class.

For example, the following query:
```python
"""
    query {
      matt: user(name: "matt") {
        email
      }
      andy: user(name: "andy") {
        email
        address {
          city
        }
        pets {
          name
          owner {
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
"""
```
can have its depth limited by the following `should_ignore`:
```python
from strawberry.extensions import IgnoreContext


def should_ignore(ignore: IgnoreContext):
    return ignore.field_args.get("name") == "matt"


query_depth_limiter = QueryDepthLimiter(should_ignore=should_ignore)
```
so that it *effectively* becomes:
```python
"""
    query {
      andy: user(name: "andy") {
        email
        pets {
          name
          owner {
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
"""

0.169.0 - 2023-04-05
--------------------

This release updates all\* the HTTP integration to use the same base class,
which makes it easier to maintain and extend them in future releases.

While this doesn't provide any new features (other than settings headers in
Chalice and Sanic), it does make it easier to extend the HTTP integrations in
the future. So, expect some new features in the next releases!

**New features:**

Now both Chalice and Sanic integrations support setting headers in the response.
Bringing them to the same level as the other HTTP integrations.

**Breaking changes:**

Unfortunately, this release does contain some breaking changes, but they are
minimal and should be quick to fix.

1. Flask `get_root_value` and `get_context` now receive the request
2. Sanic `get_root_value` now receives the request and it is async

\* The only exception is the channels http integration, which will be updated in
a future release.

0.168.2 - 2023-04-03

Fixes type hint for StrawberryTypeFromPydantic._pydantic_type to be a Type instead of an instance of the Pydantic model.
As it is a private API, we still highly discourage using it, but it's now typed correctly.

0.164.0 - 2023-03-14
--------------------

This release introduces a breaking change to make pydantic default behavior consistent with normal strawberry types.
This changes the schema generated for pydantic types, that are required, and have default values.
Previously pydantic type with a default, would get converted to a strawberry type that is not required.
This is now fixed, and the schema will now correctly show the type as required.

```python
import pydantic
import strawberry


class UserPydantic(pydantic.BaseModel):
    name: str = "James"


@strawberry.experimental.pydantic.type(UserPydantic, all_fields=True)
class User: ...


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    a: User = strawberry.field()

    @strawberry.field
    def a(self) -> User:
        return User()
```
The schema is now
```
type Query {
  a: User!
}

type User {
  name: String! // String! rather than String previously
}
```

Calling `ChannelsConsumer.channel_listen` multiple times will now pass

only one of the callers, which was the old behaviour.

subscriptions (in a non-deterministic order) being triggered if they
are listening for channel layer messages of the same type.

0.157.0 - 2023-02-18
--------------------

This releases adds support for Apollo Federation 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3.

This includes support for `@composeDirective` and `@interfaceObject`,
we expose directives for both, but we also have shortcuts, for example
to use `@composeDirective` with a custom schema directive, you can do
the following:

```python
@strawberry.federation.schema_directive(
    locations=[Location.OBJECT], name="cacheControl", compose=True
)
class CacheControl:
    max_age: int
```

The `compose=True` makes so that this directive is included in the supergraph
schema.

For `@interfaceObject` we introduced a new `@strawberry.federation.interface_object`
decorator. This works like `@strawberry.federation.type`, but it adds, the appropriate
directive, for example:

```python
@strawberry.federation.interface_object(keys=["id"])
class SomeInterface:
    id: strawberry.ID
```

generates the following type:

```graphql
type SomeInterface @key(fields: "id") @interfaceObject {
  id: ID!
}

error from Pyright when using async resolver, like the following example:

```python

0.156.0 - 2023-02-08
--------------------

This release adds support for specialized generic types.
Before, the following code would give an error, saying that `T` was not
provided to the generic type:

```python
@strawberry.type
class Foo(Generic[T]):
    some_var: T


@strawberry.type
class IntFoo(Foo[int]): ...


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    int_foo: IntFoo
```

Also, because the type is already specialized, `Int` won't get inserted to its name,
meaning it will be exported to the schema with a type name of `IntFoo` and not
`IntIntFoo`.

For example, this query:

```python
@strawberry.type
class Query:
    int_foo: IntFoo
    str_foo: Foo[str]
```

Will generate a schema like this:

```graphql
type IntFoo {
  someVar: Int!
}

type StrFoo {
  someVar: String!
}

type Query {
  intFoo: IntFoo!
  strfoo: StrFoo!
}
```

    age: int


# should be {"name": "Lorem", "age": 25}
user_dict = strawberry.asdict(User(name="Lorem", age=25))

> Note: This function uses the `dataclasses.asdict` function under the hood, so
> you can safely replace `dataclasses.asdict` with `strawberry.asdict` in your

0.154.0 - 2023-01-13
--------------------

Support constrained float field types in Pydantic models.

i.e.

```python
import pydantic


class Model(pydantic.BaseModel):
    field: pydantic.confloat(le=100.0)
    equivalent_field: float = pydantic.Field(le=100.0)

0.153.0 - 2023-01-13
--------------------

This change allows clients to define connectionParams when making Subscription requests similar to the way [Apollo-Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/subscriptions/#operation-context) does it.

With [Apollo-Client (React)](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/subscriptions/#5-authenticate-over-websocket-optional) as an example, define a Websocket Link:
```
import { GraphQLWsLink } from '@apollo/client/link/subscriptions';
import { createClient } from 'graphql-ws';

const wsLink = new GraphQLWsLink(createClient({
  url: 'ws://localhost:4000/subscriptions',
  connectionParams: {
    authToken: user.authToken,
  },
}));
```
and the JSON passed to `connectionParams` here will appear within Strawberry's context as the `connection_params` attribute when accessing `info.context` within a Subscription resolver.

0.152.0 - 2023-01-10
--------------------

This release adds support for updating (or adding) the query document inside an
extension's `on_request_start` method.

This can be useful for implementing persisted queries. The old behavior of
returning a 400 error if no query is present in the request is still supported.

Example usage:

```python
from strawberry.extensions import Extension


def get_doc_id(request) -> str:
    """Implement this to get the document ID using your framework's request object"""
    ...


def load_persisted_query(doc_id: str) -> str:
    """Implement this load a query by document ID. For example, from a database."""
    ...


class PersistedQuery(Extension):
    def on_request_start(self):
        request = self.execution_context.context.request

        doc_id = get_doc_id(request)

        self.execution_context.query = load_persisted_query(doc_id)

0.151.2 - 2022-12-23
--------------------

This release fixes `@strawberry.experimental.pydantic.type` and adds support for the metadata attribute on fields.

Example:
```python

class UserType:
    private: strawberry.auto = strawberry.field(metadata={"admin_only": True})
    public: strawberry.auto

```python
@strawberry.enum
class EstimatedValueEnum(Enum):
    test = "test"
    testtest = "testtest"


@strawberry.type
class EstimatedValue(Generic[T]):
    value: T

0.151.0 - 2022-12-13
--------------------

This PR adds a new `graphql_type` parameter to strawberry.field that allows you
to explicitly set the field type. This parameter will take preference over the
resolver return type and the class field type.

For example:

```python
@strawberry.type
class Query:
    a: float = strawberry.field(graphql_type=str)
    b = strawberry.field(graphql_type=int)

    @strawberry.field(graphql_type=float)
    def c(self) -> str:
        return "3.4"


schema = strawberry.Schema(Query)

str(
    schema
) == """
  type Query {
    a: String!
    b: Int!
    c: Float!
  }
"""

0.150.1 - 2022-12-13
--------------------

Fixed field resolvers with nested generic return types
(e.g. `list`, `Optional`, `Union` etc) raising TypeErrors.
This means resolver factory methods can now be correctly type hinted.

For example the below would previously error unless you ommited all the
type hints on `resolver_factory` and `actual_resolver` functions.
```python
from typing import Callable, Optional, Type, TypeVar

import strawberry


@strawberry.type
class Cat:
    name: str


T = TypeVar("T")


def resolver_factory(type_: Type[T]) -> Callable[[], Optional[T]]:
    def actual_resolver() -> Optional[T]:
        # load rows from database and cast to type etc
        ...

    return actual_resolver


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    cat: Cat = strawberry.field(resolver_factory(Cat))


schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query)

0.150.0 - 2022-12-13
--------------------

This release implements the ability to use custom caching for dataloaders.
It also allows to provide a `cache_key_fn` to the dataloader. This function
is used to generate the cache key for the dataloader. This is useful when
you want to use a custom hashing function for the cache key.

This release fixes support for generics in arguments, see the following example:

 ```python
 T = TypeVar("T")


 @strawberry.type

0.149.1 - 2022-12-09
--------------------

This release improves the performance of rich exceptions on custom scalars
by changing how frames are fetched from the call stack.
Before the change, custom scalars were using a CPU intensive call to the
`inspect` module to fetch frame info which could lead to serious CPU spikes.

0.149.0 - 2022-12-09
--------------------

This release does some internal refactoring of the HTTP views, hopefully it
doesn't affect anyone. It mostly changes the status codes returned in case of
errors (e.g. bad JSON, missing queries and so on).

It also improves the testing, and adds an entirely new test suite for the HTTP
views, this means in future we'll be able to keep all the HTTP views in sync
feature-wise.

0.148.0 - 2022-12-08
--------------------

This release changes the `get_context`, `get_root_value` and `process_result`
methods of the Flask async view to be async functions. This allows you to use
async code in these methods.

0.147.0 - 2022-12-08
--------------------

This release introduces a `encode_json` method on all the HTTP integrations.
This method allows to customize the encoding of the JSON response. By default we
use `json.dumps` but you can override this method to use a different encoder.

It also deprecates `json_encoder` and `json_dumps_params` in the Django and
Sanic views, `encode_json` should be used instead.

0.146.0 - 2022-12-05
--------------------

This release updates the Sanic integration and includes some breaking changes.
You might need to update your code if you are customizing `get_context` or
`process_result`

## `get_context`

`get_context` now receives the request as the first argument and the response as
the second argument.

## `process_result`

`process_result` is now async and receives the request and the GraphQL execution
result.

This change is needed to align all the HTTP integrations and reduce the amount
of code needed to maintain. It also makes the errors consistent with other
integrations.

It also brings a **new feature** and it allows to customize the HTTP status code
by using `info.context["response"].status_code = YOUR_CODE`.

It also removes the upper bound on the Sanic version, so you can use the latest
version of Sanic with Strawberry.

0.145.0 - 2022-12-04
--------------------

This release introduced improved errors! Now, when you have a syntax error in
your code, you'll get a nice error message with a line number and a pointer to
the exact location of the error. ✨

This is a huge improvement over the previous behavior, which was providing a
stack trace with no clear indication of where the error was. 🙈

You can enable rich errors by installing Strawberry with the `cli` extra:

```bash
pip install "strawberry-graphql[cli]"
```

0.144.3 - 2022-12-04
--------------------

This release fixes an issue with type duplication of generics.

You can now use a lazy type with a generic even if
the original type was already used with that generic in the schema.

Example:

```python3
@strawberry.type
class Query:
    regular: Edge[User]
    lazy: Edge[Annotated["User", strawberry.lazy(".user")]]

0.141.0 - 2022-11-10
--------------------

This release adds support for an implicit `resolve_reference` method
on Federation type. This method will automatically create a Strawberry
instance for a federation type based on the input data received, for
example, the following:

```python
@strawberry.federation.type(keys=["id"])
class Something:
    id: str


@strawberry.federation.type(keys=["upc"])
class Product:
    upc: str
    something: Something

    @staticmethod
    def resolve_reference(**data):
        return Product(upc=data["upc"], something=Something(id=data["something_id"]))
```

doesn't need the resolve_reference method anymore.

0.133.3 - 2022-10-03
--------------------

This release allows to create a federation schema without having to pass a
`Query` type. This is useful when your schema only extends some types without
adding any additional root field.

```python
@strawberry.federation.type(keys=["id"])
class Location:
    id: strawberry.ID
    name: str = strawberry.federation.field(override="start")


schema = strawberry.federation.Schema(types=[Location])

0.133.0 - 2022-09-27
--------------------

Reduce the number of required dependencies, by marking Pygments and python-multipart as optional. These dependencies are still necessary for some functionality, and so users of that functionality need to ensure they're installed, either explicitly or via an extra:

- Pygments is still necessary when using Strawberry in debug mode, and is included in the `strawberry[debug-server]` extra.
- python-multipart is still necessary when using `strawberry.file_uploads.Upload` with FastAPI or Starlette, and is included in the `strawberry[fastapi]` and `strawberry[asgi]` extras, respectively.

There is now also the `strawberry[cli]` extra to support commands like `strawberry codegen` and `strawberry export-schema`.

0.132.1 - 2022-09-23
--------------------

Improve resolving performance by avoiding extra calls for basic fields.

This change improves performance of resolving a query by skipping `Info`
creation and permission checking for fields that don't have a resolver
or permission classes. In local benchmarks it improves performance of large
results by ~14%.

0.131.5 - 2022-09-22
--------------------

Fixes false positives with the mypy plugin.
Happened when `to_pydantic` was called on a type that was converted
pydantic with all_fields=True.

Also fixes the type signature when `to_pydantic` is defined by the user.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional
import strawberry


class MyModel(BaseModel):
    email: str
    password: Optional[str]


@strawberry.experimental.pydantic.input(model=MyModel, all_fields=True)

0.129.0 - 2022-09-11
--------------------

This release adds `strawberry.lazy` which allows you to define the type of the
field and its path. This is useful when you want to define a field with a type
that has a circular dependency.

For example, let's say we have a `User` type that has a list of `Post` and a
`Post` type that has a `User`:

```python
# posts.py
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Annotated

import strawberry

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from .users import User


@strawberry.type
class Post:
    title: str
    author: Annotated["User", strawberry.lazy(".users")]
```

```python
# users.py
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Annotated, List

import strawberry

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from .posts import Post


@strawberry.type
class User:
    name: str
    posts: List[Annotated["Post", strawberry.lazy(".posts")]]
```

0.128.0 - 2022-09-05
--------------------

This release changes how dataclasses are created to make use of the new
`kw_only` argument in Python 3.10 so that fields without a default value can now
follow a field with a default value. This feature is also backported to all other
supported Python versions.

More info: https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#dataclasses.dataclass

For example:

```python
# This no longer raises a TypeError


@strawberry.type
class MyType:
    a: str = "Hi"
    b: int
```

⚠️ This is a breaking change! Whenever instantiating a Strawberry type make sure
that you only pass values are keyword arguments:

```python
# Before:

MyType("foo", 3)

# After:

MyType(a="foo", b=3)
```

0.127.2 - 2022-08-30
--------------------

This release adds support for passing schema directives to
`Schema(..., types=[])`. This can be useful if using a built-inschema directive
that's not supported by a gateway.

For example the following:

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry.scalars import JSON
from strawberry.schema_directive import Location


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    example: JSON


@strawberry.schema_directive(locations=[Location.SCALAR], name="specifiedBy")
class SpecifiedBy:
    name: str


schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query, types=[SpecifiedBy])
```

will print the following SDL:

```graphql
directive @specifiedBy(name: String!) on SCALAR

"""
The `JSON` scalar type represents JSON values as specified by [ECMA-404](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf).

    VANILLA = strawberry.enum_value("vanilla")
    STRAWBERRY = strawberry.enum_value(
        "strawberry",
        description="Our favourite",

    CHOCOLATE = "chocolate"


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    favorite_ice_cream: IceCreamFlavour = IceCreamFlavour.STRAWBERRY


schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query)
```

This produces the following schema

```graphql

  VANILLA

  """Our favourite."""
  STRAWBERRY
  CHOCOLATE

class Sensitive:
    reason: Reason


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    first_name: str = strawberry.field(directives=[Sensitive(reason=Reason.EXAMPLE)])
```

prints the following:

```graphql
directive @sensitive(reason: Reason!) on FIELD_DEFINITION

type Query {
    firstName: String! @sensitive(reason: EXAMPLE)
}

enum Reason {
    EXAMPLE
}
```

while previously it would omit the definition of the enum.

SensitiveConfiguration = strawberry.scalar(str, name="SensitiveConfiguration")


@strawberry.schema_directive(locations=[Location.FIELD_DEFINITION])
class Sensitive:
    config: SensitiveConfiguration


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    first_name: str = strawberry.field(directives=[Sensitive(config="Some config")])

prints the following:

```graphql
directive @sensitive(config: SensitiveConfiguration!) on FIELD_DEFINITION

type Query {
    firstName: String! @sensitive(config: "Some config")

This release adds support for overriding the default resolver for fields.

Currently the default resolver is `getattr`, but now you can change it to any
function you like, for example you can allow returning dictionaries:

```python
@strawberry.type
class User:
    name: str


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def user(self) -> User:
        return {"name": "Patrick"}  # type: ignore

0.119.2 - 2022-07-23
--------------------

Fixed edge case where `Union` types raised an `UnallowedReturnTypeForUnion`
error when returning the correct type from the resolver. This also improves
performance of StrawberryUnion's `_resolve_union_type` from `O(n)` to `O(1)` in
the majority of cases where `n` is the number of types in the schema.

For
[example the below](https://play.strawberry.rocks/?gist=f7d88898d127e65b12140fdd763f9ef2))
would previously raise the error when querying `two` as `StrawberryUnion` would
incorrectly determine that the resolver returns `Container[TypeOne]`.

```python
import strawberry
from typing import TypeVar, Generic, Union, List, Type

T = TypeVar("T")


@strawberry.type
class Container(Generic[T]):
    items: List[T]


@strawberry.type
class TypeOne:
    attr: str


@strawberry.type
class TypeTwo:
    attr: str


def resolver_one():
    return Container(items=[TypeOne("one")])


def resolver_two():
    return Container(items=[TypeTwo("two")])


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    one: Union[Container[TypeOne], TypeOne] = strawberry.field(resolver_one)
    two: Union[Container[TypeTwo], TypeTwo] = strawberry.field(resolver_two)

0.116.1 - 2022-07-03
--------------------

This release fixes a breaking internal error in mypy plugin for the following case.
- using positional arguments to pass a resolver for `strawberry.field()` or `strawberry.mutation()`

```python
failed: str = strawberry.field(resolver)
successed: str = strawberry.field(resolver=resolver)
```

now mypy returns an error with `"field()" or "mutation()" only takes keyword arguments` message
rather than an internal error.

0.116.0 - 2022-07-03
--------------------

This release adds a link from generated GraphQLCore types to the Strawberry type
that generated them.

From a GraphQLCore type you can now access the Strawberry type by doing:

```python
strawberry_type: TypeDefinition = graphql_core_type.extensions[
    GraphQLCoreConverter.DEFINITION_BACKREF
]
```

0.115.0 - 2022-07-01
--------------------

This release changes how we declare the `info` argument in resolvers and the
`value` argument in directives.

Previously we'd use the name of the argument to determine its value. Now we use
the type annotation of the argument to determine its value.

Here's an example of how the old syntax works:

```python
def some_resolver(info) -> str:
    return info.context.get("some_key", "default")


@strawberry.type
class Example:
    a_field: str = strawberry.resolver(some_resolver)
```

and here's an example of how the new syntax works:

```python
from strawberry.types import Info


def some_resolver(info: strawberry.Info) -> str:
    return info.context.get("some_key", "default")


@strawberry.type
class Example:
    a_field: str = strawberry.resolver(some_resolver)
```

This means that you can now use a different name for the `info` argument in your
resolver and the `value` argument in your directive.

Here's an example that uses a custom name for both the value and the info
parameter in directives:

```python
from strawberry.types import Info
from strawberry.directive import DirectiveLocation, DirectiveValue


@strawberry.type
class Cake:
    frosting: Optional[str] = None
    flavor: str = "Chocolate"


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def cake(self) -> Cake:
        return Cake()


@strawberry.directive(
    locations=[DirectiveLocation.FIELD],
    description="Add frosting with ``value`` to a cake.",
)
def add_frosting(value: str, v: DirectiveValue[Cake], my_info: strawberry.Info):
    # Arbitrary argument name when using `DirectiveValue` is supported!
    assert isinstance(v, Cake)
    if (
        value in my_info.context["allergies"]
    ):  # Info can now be accessed from directives!
        raise AllergyError("You are allergic to this frosting!")
    else:
        v.frosting = value  # Value can now be used as a GraphQL argument name!
    return v
```

**Note:** the old way of passing arguments by name is deprecated and will be
removed in future releases of Strawberry.

0.114.7 - 2022-07-01
--------------------

Allow use of implicit `Any` in `strawberry.Private` annotated Generic types.

For example the following is now supported:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from typing import Generic, Sequence, TypeVar

import strawberry


T = TypeVar("T")


@strawberry.type
class Foo(Generic[T]):
    private_field: strawberry.Private[Sequence]  # instead of Sequence[Any]


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def foo(self) -> Foo[str]:
        return Foo(private_field=[1, 2, 3])
```

0.114.6 - 2022-06-30
--------------------

The federation decorator now allows for a list of additional arbitrary schema
directives extending the key/shareable directives used for federation.

Example Python:

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry.schema.config import StrawberryConfig
from strawberry.schema_directive import Location


@strawberry.schema_directive(locations=[Location.OBJECT])
class CacheControl:
    max_age: int


@strawberry.federation.type(
    keys=["id"], shareable=True, extend=True, directives=[CacheControl(max_age=42)]
)
class FederatedType:
    id: strawberry.ID


schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query, config=StrawberryConfig(auto_camel_case=False))
```

Resulting GQL Schema:

```graphql
directive @CacheControl(max_age: Int!) on OBJECT
directive @key(fields: _FieldSet!, resolvable: Boolean) on OBJECT | INTERFACE
directive @shareable on FIELD_DEFINITION | OBJECT

extend type FederatedType
  @key(fields: "id")
  @shareable
  @CacheControl(max_age: 42) {
  id: ID!
}

type Query {
  federatedType: FederatedType!
}

This release adds support for Apollo Federation 2 directives:
- @shareable
- @tag
- @override

This release does **not** add support for the @link directive.

This release updates the @key directive to align with Apollo Federation 2 updates.

See the below code snippet and/or the newly-added test cases for examples on how to use the new directives.
The below snippet demonstrates the @override directive.
```python
import strawberry
from typing import List


@strawberry.interface
class SomeInterface:
    id: strawberry.ID


@strawberry.federation.type(keys=["upc"], extend=True)
class Product(SomeInterface):
    upc: str = strawberry.federation.field(external=True, override=["mySubGraph"])


@strawberry.federation.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def top_products(self, first: int) -> List[Product]:
        return []


schema = strawberry.federation.Schema(query=Query)
```

should return:

```graphql

0.106.1 - 2022-04-14
--------------------

This release fixes a number of problems with single-result-operations over
`graphql-transport-ws` protocol

- operation **IDs** now share the same namespace as streaming operations
  meaning that they cannot be reused while the others are in operation

- single-result-operations now run as *tasks* meaning that messages related
  to them can be overlapped with other messages on the websocket.

- single-result-operations can be cancelled with the `complete` message.

- IDs for single result and streaming result operations are now released
  once the operation is done, allowing them to be re-used later, as well as
  freeing up resources related to previous requests.

0.106.0 - 2022-04-14
--------------------

This release adds an implementation of the `GraphQLTestClient` for the `aiohttp` integration (in addition to the existing `asgi` and `Django` support). It hides the HTTP request's details and verifies that there are no errors in the response (this behavior can be disabled by passing `asserts_errors=False`). This makes it easier to test queries and makes your tests cleaner.

If you are using `pytest` you can add a fixture in `conftest.py`

```python
import pytest

from strawberry.aiohttp.test.client import GraphQLTestClient


@pytest.fixture
def graphql_client(aiohttp_client, myapp):
    yield GraphQLTestClient(aiohttp_client(myapp))
```

And use it everywhere in your tests

```python
def test_strawberry(graphql_client):
    query = """
        query Hi($name: String!) {
            hi(name: $name)
        }
    """

    result = graphql_client.query(query, variables={"name": "🍓"})

    assert result.data == {"hi": "Hi 🍓!"}

This release adds an experimental codegen feature for queries.
It allows to combine a graphql query and Strawberry schema to generate
Python types or TypeScript types.

You can use the following command:

```bash
strawberry codegen --schema schema --output-dir ./output -p python query.graphql
```

to generate python types that correspond to your GraphQL query.

0.102.3 - 2022-03-14
--------------------

This release makes StrawberryOptional and StrawberryList hashable,
allowing to use strawberry types with libraries like dacite and
dataclasses_json.

Contributed by [Patrick Arminio](https://github.com/patrick91) via [PR #1726](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/1726/)


0.102.2 - 2022-03-08
--------------------

Add support for postponed evaluation of annotations
([PEP-563](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0563/)) to `strawberry.Private`
annotated fields.

## Example

This release fixes Issue #1586 using schema-conversion time filtering of
`strawberry.Private` fields for PEP-563. This means the following is now
supported:

```python
@strawberry.type
class Query:
    foo: "strawberry.Private[int]"
```

Forward references are supported as well:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from dataclasses import dataclass


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    private_foo: strawberry.Private[SensitiveData]

    @strawberry.field
    def foo(self) -> int:
        return self.private_foo.visible


@dataclass
class SensitiveData:
    visible: int
    not_visible: int
```

This PR improves the support for scalars when using MyPy.

Contributed by [Patrick Arminio](https://github.com/patrick91) via [PR #1205](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/1205/)


0.102.0 - 2022-03-07
--------------------

Added the response object to `get_context` on the `flask` view. This means that in fields, something like this can be used;

```python
@strawberry.field
def response_check(self, info: strawberry.Info) -> bool:
    response: Response = info.context["response"]
    response.status_code = 401

    return True
```

0.101.0 - 2022-03-06
--------------------

This release adds support for `graphql-transport-ws` single result operations.

Single result operations allow clients to execute queries and mutations over an existing WebSocket connection.

0.100.0 - 2022-03-05
--------------------

Change `strawberry.auto` to be a type instead of a sentinel.
This not only removes the dependency on sentinel from the project, but also fixes
some related issues, like the fact that only types can be used with `Annotated`.

Also, custom scalars will now trick static type checkers into thinking they
returned their wrapped type. This should fix issues with pyright 1.1.224+ where
it doesn't allow non-type objects to be used as annotations for dataclasses and
dataclass-alike classes (which is strawberry's case). The change to `strawberry.auto`
also fixes this issue for it.

0.99.0 - 2022-02-28
-------------------

This release adds the following scalar types:

- `JSON`
- `Base16`
- `Base32`
- `Base64`

they can be used like so:

```python
from strawberry.scalar import Base16, Base32, Base64, JSON


@strawberry.type
class Example:
    a: Base16
    b: Base32
    c: Base64
    d: JSON
```

0.98.2 - 2022-02-24
-------------------

Adds support for converting pydantic conlist.
Note that constraint is not enforced in the graphql type.
Thus, we recommend always working on the pydantic type such that the validation is enforced.

```python
import strawberry
from pydantic import BaseModel, conlist


class Example(BaseModel):
    friends: conlist(str, min_items=1)


@strawberry.experimental.pydantic.input(model=Example, all_fields=True)
class ExampleGQL: ...


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field()
    def test(self, example: ExampleGQL) -> None:
        # friends may be an empty list here
        print(example.friends)
        # calling to_pydantic() runs the validation and raises
        # an error if friends is empty
        print(example.to_pydantic().friends)


schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query)
```

The converted graphql type is
```
input ExampleGQL {
  friends: [String!]!
}
```

0.98.1 - 2022-02-24
-------------------

This release wasn't published on PyPI

0.98.0 - 2022-02-23
-------------------

This release updates `graphql-core` to `3.2.0`

Make sure you take a look at [`graphql-core`'s release notes](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-core/releases/tag/v3.2.0)
for any potential breaking change that might affect you if you're importing things
from the `graphql` package directly.

0.97.0 - 2022-02-17
-------------------

Support "void" functions

It is now possible to have a resolver that returns "None". Strawberry will automatically assign the new `Void` scalar in the schema
and will always send `null` in the response

## Exampe

```python
@strawberry.type
class Mutation:
    @strawberry.field
    def do_something(self, arg: int) -> None:
        return
```
results in this schema:
```grapqhl
type Mutation {
    doSomething(arg: Int!): Void
}
```

0.96.0 - 2022-02-07
-------------------

Add better support for custom Pydantic conversion logic and standardize the
behavior when not using `strawberry.auto` as the type.

See https://strawberry.rocks/docs/integrations/pydantic#custom-conversion-logic for details and examples.

Note that this release fixes a bug related to Pydantic aliases in schema
generation. If you have a field with the same name as an aliased Pydantic field
but with a different type than `strawberry.auto`, the generated field will now
use the alias name. This may cause schema changes on upgrade in these cases, so
care should be taken. The alias behavior can be disabled by setting the
`use_pydantic_alias` option of the decorator to false.

0.95.5 - 2022-02-07
-------------------

Adds support for `use_pydantic_alias` parameter in pydantic model conversion.
Decides if the all the GraphQL field names for the generated type should use the alias name or not.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
import strawberry


class UserModel(BaseModel):
    id: int = Field(..., alias="my_alias_name")


@strawberry.experimental.pydantic.type(UserModel, use_pydantic_alias=False)
class User:
    id: strawberry.auto
```

If `use_pydantic_alias` is `False`, the GraphQL type User will use `id` for the name of the `id` field coming from the Pydantic model.
```
type User {
      id: Int!
}
```

With `use_pydantic_alias` set to `True` (the default behaviour) the GraphQL type user will use `myAliasName` for the `id` field coming from the Pydantic models (since the field has a `alias` specified`)
```
type User {
      myAliasName: Int!
}
```

`use_pydantic_alias` is set to `True` for backwards compatibility.

0.95.2 - 2022-02-02
-------------------

This release fixes an issue with the name generation for nested generics,
the following:

```python
T = TypeVar("T")
K = TypeVar("K")
V = TypeVar("V")


@strawberry.type
class Value(Generic[T]):
    value: T


@strawberry.type
class DictItem(Generic[K, V]):
    key: K
    value: V


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    d: Value[List[DictItem[int, str]]]
```

now yields the correct schema:

```graphql
type IntStrDictItem {
  key: Int!
  value: String!
}

type IntStrDictItemListValue {
  value: [IntStrDictItem!]!
}

type Query {
  d: IntStrDictItemListValue!
}
```

Adds `to_pydantic` and `from_pydantic` type hints for IDE support.

Adds mypy extension support as well.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class UserPydantic(BaseModel):
    age: int


@strawberry.experimental.pydantic.type(UserPydantic)
class UserStrawberry:
    age: strawberry.auto


reveal_type(UserStrawberry(age=123).to_pydantic())
```
Mypy will infer the type as "UserPydantic". Previously it would be "Any"

0.93.23 - 2022-01-11
--------------------

Improve typing of `@strawberry.enum()` by:

1. Using a `TypeVar` bound on `EnumMeta` instead of `EnumMeta`, which allows
   type-checkers (like pyright) to detect the fields of the enum being
   decorated. For example, for the following enum:

```python
@strawberry.enum
class IceCreamFlavour(Enum):
    VANILLA = "vanilla"
    STRAWBERRY = "strawberry"
    CHOCOLATE = "chocolate"
```

Prior to this change, pyright would complain if you tried to access
`IceCreamFlavour.VANILLA`, since the type information of `IceCreamFlavour` was
being erased by the `EnumMeta` typing .

2. Overloading it so that type-checkers (like pyright) knows in what cases it
   returns a decorator (when it's called with keyword arguments, e.g.
   `@strawberry.enum(name="IceCreamFlavor")`), versus when it returns the
   original enum type (without keyword arguments.

0.93.20 - 2022-01-07
--------------------

This release checks for AutoFieldsNotInBaseModelError when converting from pydantic models.
 It is raised when strawberry.auto is used, but the pydantic model does not have
the particular field defined.

```python
class User(BaseModel):
    age: int


@strawberry.experimental.pydantic.type(User)
class UserType:
    age: strawberry.auto
    password: strawberry.auto
```

Previously no errors would be raised, and the password field would not appear on graphql schema.
Such mistakes could be common during refactoring. Now, AutoFieldsNotInBaseModelError is raised.

0.92.1 - 2021-12-04
-------------------

Fix cross-module type resolving for fields and resolvers

The following two issues are now fixed:

- A field with a generic (typeless) resolver looks up the
  type relative to the resolver and not the class the field is
  defined in. (#1448)

- When inheriting fields from another class the origin of the
  fields are set to the inheriting class and not the class the
  field is defined in.

Both these issues could lead to a rather undescriptive error message:

0.92.0 - 2021-12-04
-------------------

This releases fixes an issue where you were not allowed
to return a non-strawberry type for fields that return
an interface. Now this works as long as each type
implementing the interface implements an `is_type_of`
classmethod. Previous automatic duck typing on types
that implement an interface now requires explicit
resolution using this classmethod.

0.91.0 - 2021-12-04
-------------------

This release adds a `GraphQLTestClient`. It hides the http request's details and asserts that there are no errors in the response (you can always disable this behavior by passing `asserts_errors=False`). This makes it easier to test queries and makes your tests cleaner.

If you are using `pytest` you can add a fixture in `conftest.py`

```python
import pytest

from django.test.client import Client

from strawberry.django.test import GraphQLTestClient


@pytest.fixture
def graphql_client():
    yield GraphQLTestClient(Client())
```

And use it everywere in your test methods

```python
def test_strawberry(graphql_client):
    query = """
        query Hi($name: String!) {
            hi(name: $name)
        }
    """

    result = graphql_client.query(query, variables={"name": "Marcotte"})

    assert result.data == {"hi": "Hi Marcotte!"}
```

It can be used to test the file uploads as well

```python
from django.core.files.uploadedfile import SimpleUploadedFile


def test_upload(graphql_client):
    f = SimpleUploadedFile("file.txt", b"strawberry")
    query = """
        mutation($textFile: Upload!) {
            readText(textFile: $textFile)
        }
    """

    response = graphql_client.query(
        query=query,
        variables={"textFile": None},
        files={"textFile": f},
    )

    assert response.data["readText"] == "strawberry"

Adds support for the `auto` type annotation described in #1192 to the Pydantic
integration, which allows a user to define the list of fields without having to
re-specify the type themselves. This gives better editor and type checker
support. If you want to expose every field you can instead pass
`all_fields=True` to the decorators and leave the body empty.

```python

0.80.0 - 2021-09-30

This release adds support for the `graphql-transport-ws` GraphQL over WebSocket
protocol. Previously Strawberry only supported the legacy `graphql-ws` protocol.

Developers can decide which protocols they want to accept. The following example shows
how to do so using the ASGI integration. By default, both protocols are accepted.
Take a look at our GraphQL subscription documentation to learn more.

0.78.0 - 2021-09-22
-------------------

This release introduces some brand new extensions to help improve the
performance of your GraphQL server:

* `ParserCache` - Cache the parsing of a query in memory
* `ValidationCache` - Cache the validation step of execution

For complicated queries these 2 extensions can improve performance by over 50%!

Example:

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry.extensions import ParserCache, ValidationCache

schema = strawberry.Schema(
    Query,
    extensions=[
        ParserCache(),
        ValidationCache(),
    ],
)
```

This release also removes the `validate_queries` and `validation_rules`
parameters on the `schema.execute*` methods in favour of using the
`DisableValidation` and `AddValidationRule` extensions.

Fix the Pydantic conversion method for Enum values, and add a mechanism to specify an interface type when converting from Pydantic. The Pydantic interface is really a base dataclass for the subclasses to extend. When you do the conversion, you have to use `strawberry.experimental.pydantic.interface` to let us know that this type is an interface. You also have to use your converted interface type as the base class for the sub types as normal.

0.75.0 - 2021-09-01
-------------------

This release improves how we deal with custom scalars. Instead of being global
they are now scoped to the schema. This allows you to have multiple schemas in
the same project with different scalars.

Also you can now override the built in scalars with your own custom
implementation. Out of the box Strawberry provides you with custom scalars for
common Python types like `datetime` and `Decimal`. If you require a custom
implementation of one of these built in scalars you can now pass a map of
overrides to your schema:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone
import strawberry

EpochDateTime = strawberry.scalar(
    datetime,
    serialize=lambda value: int(value.timestamp()),
    parse_value=lambda value: datetime.fromtimestamp(int(value), timezone.utc),
)


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def current_time(self) -> datetime:
        return datetime.now()


schema = strawberry.Schema(
    Query,
    scalar_overrides={
        datetime: EpochDateTime,
    },
)
result = schema.execute_sync("{ currentTime }")
assert result.data == {"currentTime": 1628683200}

0.73.2 - 2021-08-23
-------------------

This releases fixes an issue where you were not allowed
to use duck typing and return a different type that the
type declared on the field when the type was implementing
an interface. Now this works as long as you return a type
that has the same shape as the field type.

0.73.0 - 2021-08-22
-------------------

This release adds support for asynchronous hooks to the Strawberry extension-system.
All available hooks can now be implemented either synchronously or asynchronously.

It's also possible to mix both synchronous and asynchronous hooks within one extension.


```python
from strawberry.extensions import Extension


class MyExtension(Extension):
    async def on_request_start(self):
        print("GraphQL request start")

    def on_request_end(self):

Contributed by [Patrick Arminio](https://github.com/patrick91) [PR #1074](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/1074/)


0.69.0 - 2021-07-20
-------------------

Refactor of the library's typing internals. Previously, typing was handled
individually by fields, arguments, and objects with a hodgepodge of functions to tie it
together. This change creates a unified typing system that the object, fields, and
arguments each hook into.

Mainly replaces the attributes that were stored on StrawberryArgument and
StrawberryField with a hierarchy of StrawberryTypes.

Introduces `StrawberryAnnotation`, as well as `StrawberryType` and some subclasses,
including `StrawberryList`, `StrawberryOptional`, and `StrawberryTypeVar`.

This is a breaking change if you were calling the constructor for `StrawberryField`,
`StrawberryArgument`, etc. and using arguments such as `is_optional` or `child`.

`@strawberry.field` no longer takes an argument called `type_`. It instead takes a
`StrawberryAnnotation` called `type_annotation`.

New deployment process to release new Strawberry releases

[Marco Acierno](https://github.com/marcoacierno) [PR #957](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/pull/957/)


0.63.0 - 2021-05-19
-------------------

This release adds extra values to the ExecutionContext object so that it can be
used by extensions and the `Schema.process_errors` function.

The full ExecutionContext object now looks like this:

```python
from graphql import ExecutionResult as GraphQLExecutionResult
from graphql.error.graphql_error import GraphQLError
from graphql.language import DocumentNode as GraphQLDocumentNode


@dataclasses.dataclass
class ExecutionContext:
    query: str
    context: Any = None
    variables: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    operation_name: Optional[str] = None

    graphql_document: Optional[GraphQLDocumentNode] = None
    errors: Optional[List[GraphQLError]] = None
    result: Optional[GraphQLExecutionResult] = None
```

and can be accessed in any of the extension hooks:

```python
from strawberry.extensions import Extension


class MyExtension(Extension):
    def on_request_end(self):
        result = self.execution_context.result
        # Do something with the result


schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query, extensions=[MyExtension])
```

---

Note: This release also removes the creation of an ExecutionContext object in the web
framework views. If you were relying on overriding the `get_execution_context`
function then you should change it to `get_request_data` and use the
`strawberry.http.parse_request_data` function to extract the pieces of data
needed from the incoming request.

0.62.1 - 2021-05-19
-------------------

This releases fixes an issue with the debug server that prevented the
usage of dataloaders, see: https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/issues/940

0.62.0 - 2021-05-19
-------------------

This release adds support for GraphQL subscriptions to the AIOHTTP integration.
Subscription support works out of the box and does not require any additional
configuration.

Here is an example how to get started with subscriptions in general. Note that by
specification GraphQL schemas must always define a query, even if only subscriptions
are used.

```python
import asyncio
import typing
import strawberry


@strawberry.type
class Subscription:
    @strawberry.subscription
    async def count(self, target: int = 100) -> typing.AsyncGenerator[int, None]:
        for i in range(target):
            yield i
            await asyncio.sleep(0.5)


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def _unused(self) -> str:
        return ""


schema = strawberry.Schema(subscription=Subscription, query=Query)
```

0.61.3 - 2021-05-13
-------------------

Fix `@requires(fields: ["email"])` and `@provides(fields: ["name"])` usage on a Federation field

You can use `@requires` to specify which fields you need to resolve a field

```python
import strawberry


@strawberry.federation.type(keys=["id"], extend=True)
class Product:
    id: strawberry.ID = strawberry.federation.field(external=True)
    code: str = strawberry.federation.field(external=True)

    @classmethod
    def resolve_reference(cls, id: strawberry.ID, code: str):
        return cls(id=id, code=code)

    @strawberry.federation.field(requires=["code"])
    def my_code(self) -> str:
        return self.code
```

`@provides` can be used to specify what fields are going to be resolved
by the service itself without having the Gateway to contact the external service
to resolve them.

0.61.2 - 2021-05-08
-------------------

This release adds support for the info param in resolve_reference:

```python
@strawberry.federation.type(keys=["upc"])
class Product:
    upc: str
    info: str

    @classmethod
    def resolve_reference(cls, info, upc):
        return Product(upc, info)
```

> Note: resolver reference is used when using Federation, similar to [Apollo server's __resolveReference](https://apollographql.com/docs/federation/api/apollo-federation/#__resolvereference)

0.61.1 - 2021-05-05
-------------------

This release extends the `strawberry server` command to allow the specification
of a schema symbol name within a module:

```sh
strawberry server mypackage.mymodule:myschema
```

The schema symbol name defaults to `schema` making this change backwards compatible.

0.61.0 - 2021-05-04
-------------------

This release adds file upload support to the [Sanic](https://sanicframework.org)
integration. No additional configuration is required to enable file upload support.

The following example shows how a file upload based mutation could look like:

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry.file_uploads import Upload


@strawberry.type
class Mutation:
    @strawberry.mutation
    def read_text(self, text_file: Upload) -> str:
        return text_file.read().decode()
```

0.60.0 - 2021-05-04
-------------------

This release adds an `export-schema` command to the Strawberry CLI.
Using the command you can print your schema definition to your console.
Pipes and redirection can be used to store the schema in a file.

Example usage:

```sh
strawberry export-schema mypackage.mymodule:myschema > schema.graphql
```

0.59.1 - 2021-05-04
-------------------

This release fixes an issue that prevented using `source` as name of an argument

0.59.0 - 2021-05-03
-------------------

This release adds an [aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) integration for
Strawberry. The integration provides a `GraphQLView` class which can be used to
integrate Strawberry with aiohttp:

```python
import strawberry
from aiohttp import web
from strawberry.aiohttp.views import GraphQLView


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    pass


schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query)

app = web.Application()

app.router.add_route("*", "/graphql", GraphQLView(schema=schema))
```

0.58.0 - 2021-05-03
-------------------

This release adds a function called `create_type` to create a Strawberry type from a list of fields.

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry.tools import create_type


@strawberry.field
def hello(info) -> str:
    return "World"


def get_name(info) -> str:
    return info.context.user.name


my_name = strawberry.field(name="myName", resolver=get_name)

Query = create_type("Query", [hello, my_name])

schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query)
```

0.57.4 - 2021-04-28
-------------------

This release fixes an issue when using nested lists, this now works properly:

```python
def get_polygons() -> List[List[float]]:
    return [[2.0, 6.0]]


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    polygons: List[List[float]] = strawberry.field(resolver=get_polygons)


schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query)

query = "{ polygons }"

result = schema.execute_sync(query, root_value=Query())
```

0.57.3 - 2021-04-27
-------------------

This release fixes support for generic types so that now we can also use generics for input types:

```python
T = typing.TypeVar("T")


@strawberry.input
class Input(typing.Generic[T]):
    field: T


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def field(self, input: Input[str]) -> str:
        return input.field
```

0.57.2 - 2021-04-19
-------------------

This release fixes a bug that prevented from extending a generic type when
passing a type, like here:

```python
T = typing.TypeVar("T")


@strawberry.interface
class Node(typing.Generic[T]):
    id: strawberry.ID

    def _resolve(self) -> typing.Optional[T]:
        return None


@strawberry.type
class Book(Node[str]):
    name: str


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def books(self) -> typing.List[Book]:
        return list()
```

0.57.1 - 2021-04-17
-------------------

Fix converting pydantic objects to strawberry types using `from_pydantic` when having a falsy value like 0 or ''.

0.57.0 - 2021-04-14
-------------------

Add a `process_errors` method to `strawberry.Schema` which logs all exceptions during execution to a `strawberry.execution` logger.

0.56.3 - 2021-04-13
-------------------

This release fixes the return type value from info argument of resolver.

0.56.2 - 2021-04-07
-------------------

This release improves Pydantic support to support default values and factories.

0.56.1 - 2021-04-06
-------------------

This release fixes the pydantic integration where you couldn't
convert objects to pydantic instance when they didn't have a
default value.

0.56.0 - 2021-04-05
-------------------

Add --app-dir CLI option to specify where to find the schema module to load when using
the debug server.

For example if you have a _schema_ module in a _my_app_ package under ./src, then you
can run the debug server with it using:

```bash
strawberry server --app-dir src my_app.schema
```

0.55.0 - 2021-04-05
-------------------

Add support for `default` and `default_factory` arguments in `strawberry.field`

```python
@strawberry.type
class Droid:
    name: str = strawberry.field(default="R2D2")
    aka: List[str] = strawberry.field(default_factory=lambda: ["Artoo"])
```

0.54.0 - 2021-04-03
-------------------

Internal refactoring.

* Renamed `StrawberryArgument` to `StrawberryArgumentAnnotation`
* Renamed `ArgumentDefinition` to `StrawberryArgument`
    * Renamed `ArgumentDefinition(type: ...)` argument to
      `StrawberryArgument(type_: ...)`

0.53.4 - 2021-04-03
-------------------

Fixed issue with django multipart/form-data uploads

0.53.3 - 2021-04-02
-------------------

Fix issue where StrawberryField.graphql_name would always be camelCased

0.53.2 - 2021-04-01
-------------------

This release fixes an issue with the generated `__eq__` and `__repr__` methods when defining
fields with resolvers.

This now works properly:

```python
@strawberry.type
class Query:
    a: int

    @strawberry.field
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "A"


assert Query(1) == Query(1)
assert Query(1) != Query(2)
```

0.53.1 - 2021-03-31
-------------------

Gracefully handle user-induced subscription errors.

0.53.0 - 2021-03-30
-------------------

* `FieldDefinition` has been absorbed into `StrawberryField` and now no longer exists.

* `FieldDefinition.origin_name` and `FieldDefinition.name`  have been replaced with
  `StrawberryField.python_name` and `StrawberryField.graphql_name`. This should help
  alleviate some backend confusion about which should be used for certain situations.

* `strawberry.types.type_resolver.resolve_type` has been split into
  `resolve_type_argument` and `_resolve_type` (for arguments) until `StrawberryType` is
  implemented to combine them back together. This was done to reduce the scope of this
  PR and defer changing `ArgumentDefinition` (future `StrawberryArgument`) until a
  different PR.

> Note: The constructor signature for `StrawberryField` has `type_` as an argument
> instead of `type` as was the case for `FieldDefinition`. This is done to prevent
> shadowing of builtins.

> Note: `StrawberryField.name` still exists because of the way dataclass `Field`s
work, but is an alias for `StrawberryField.python_name`.

0.52.1 - 2021-03-28
-------------------

Include `field_nodes` in Strawberry info object.

0.52.0 - 2021-03-23
-------------------

This release updates get_context in the django integration to also receive a temporal response object that can be used to set headers, cookies and status code.


```
@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def abc(self, info: strawberry.Info) -> str:
        info.context.response.status_code = 418

        return "ABC"
```

-------------------

Fix bug when using arguments inside a type that uses typing.Generics

0.49.0 - 2021-03-12
-------------------

This releases updates the ASGI class to make it easier to override `get_http_response`.

`get_http_response` has been now removed from strawberry.asgi.http and been moved to be
a method on the ASGI class.

A new `get_graphiql_response` method has been added to make it easier to provide a different GraphiQL interface.

0.48.3 - 2021-03-11
-------------------

This release updates `get_context` in the asgi integration to also
receive a temporal response object that can be used to set headers

0.45.1 - 2021-01-31
-------------------

Fix Generic name generation to use the custom name specified in Strawberry if available

```python
@strawberry.type(name="AnotherName")
class EdgeName:
    node: str


@strawberry.type
class Connection(Generic[T]):
    edge: T
```

will result in `AnotherNameConnection`, and not `EdgeNameConnection` as before.

0.45.0 - 2021-01-27
-------------------

This release add the ability to disable query validation by setting
`validate_queries` to `False`

```python
import strawberry


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def hello(self) -> str:

0.44.2 - 2020-11-22
-------------------

Validate the schema when it is created instead of at runtime.

0.44.1 - 2020-11-20
-------------------

This release adds support for strawberry.federation.field under mypy.

0.44.0 - 2020-11-19
-------------------

Creation of a `[debug-server]` extra, which is required to get going quickly with this project!

```
pip install strawberry-graphql
```

Will now install the primary portion of of the framework, allowing you to build your GraphQL
schema using the dataclasses pattern.

To get going quickly, you can install `[debug-server]` which brings along a server which allows
you to develop your API dynamically, assuming your schema is defined in the `app` module:

```
pip install 'strawberry-graphql[debug-server]'
strawberry server app
```

Typically, in a production environment, you'd want to bring your own server :)

0.43.2 - 2020-11-19
-------------------

This release fixes an issue when using unions inside generic types, this is now
supported:


```python
@strawberry.type
class Dog:
    name: str


@strawberry.type
class Cat:
    name: str


@strawberry.type
class Connection(Generic[T]):
    nodes: List[T]


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    connection: Connection[Union[Dog, Cat]]
```

0.43.1 - 2020-11-18
-------------------

This releases fixes an issue with Strawberry requiring Pydantic even when not used.

0.43.0 - 2020-11-18
-------------------

This release adds support for creating types from Pydantic models. Here's an
example:

```python
import strawberry

from datetime import datetime
from typing import List, Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel


class UserModel(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name = "John Doe"
    signup_ts: Optional[datetime] = None
    friends: List[int] = []


@strawberry.experimental.pydantic.type(
    model=UserModel, fields=["id", "name", "friends"]
)
class UserType:
    pass
```

0.42.7 - 2020-11-18
-------------------

Add some checks to make sure the types passed to `.union` are valid.

0.42.6 - 2020-11-18
-------------------

Fix issue preventing reusing the same resolver for multiple fields, like here:

```python
def get_name(self) -> str:
    return "Name"


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    name: str = strawberry.field(resolver=get_name)
    name_2: str = strawberry.field(resolver=get_name)
```

0.42.5 - 2020-11-18
-------------------

Another small improvement for mypy, this should prevent mypy from crashing when it can't find a type

0.42.4 - 2020-11-18
-------------------

This release fixes another issue with mypy where it wasn't able to identify strawberry fields.
It also now knows that fields with resolvers aren't put in the __init__ method of the class.

0.42.3 - 2020-11-17
-------------------

This release type improves support for strawberry.field in mypy,
now we don't get `Attributes without a default cannot follow attributes with one`
when using strawberry.field before a type without a default.

0.42.2 - 2020-11-17
-------------------

Bugfix to allow the use of `UNSET` as a default value for arguments.

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry.arguments import UNSET, is_unset


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def hello(self, name: Optional[str] = UNSET) -> str:
        if is_unset(name):
            return "Hi there"
        return "Hi {name}"


schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query)

result = schema.execute_async("{ hello }")
assert result.data == {"hello": "Hi there"}

result = schema.execute_async('{ hello(name: "Patrick" }')
assert result.data == {"hello": "Hi Patrick"}
```

SDL:

```graphql
type Query {
  hello(name: String): String!
}
```

0.42.1 - 2020-11-17
-------------------

This release improves mypy support for strawberry.field

0.42.0 - 2020-11-17
-------------------

* Completely revamped how resolvers are created, stored, and managed by
  StrawberryField. Now instead of monkeypatching a `FieldDefinition` object onto
  the resolver function itself, all resolvers are wrapped inside of a
  `StrawberryResolver` object with the useful properties.
* `arguments.get_arguments_from_resolver` is now the
  `StrawberryResolver.arguments` property
* Added a test to cover a situation where a field is added to a StrawberryType
  manually using `dataclasses.field` but not annotated. This was previously
  uncaught.

0.41.1 - 2020-11-14
-------------------

This release fixes an issue with forward types

0.41.0 - 2020-11-06
-------------------

This release adds a built-in dataloader. Example:

```python
async def app():
    async def idx(keys):
        return keys

    loader = DataLoader(load_fn=idx)

    [value_a, value_b, value_c] = await asyncio.gather(
        loader.load(1),
        loader.load(2),
        loader.load(3),
    )

    assert value_a == 1
    assert value_b == 2
    assert value_c == 3
```

0.40.2 - 2020-11-05
-------------------

Allow interfaces to implement other interfaces.
This may be useful if you are using the relay pattern
or if you want to model base interfaces that can be extended.

Example:
```python
import strawberry


@strawberry.interface
class Error:
    message: str


@strawberry.interface
class FieldError(Error):
    message: str
    field: str


@strawberry.type
class PasswordTooShort(FieldError):
    message: str
    field: str
    fix: str
```
Produces the following SDL:
```graphql
interface Error {
  message: String!
}

interface FieldError implements Error {
  message: String!
  field: String!
}

type PasswordTooShort implements FieldError & Error {
  message: String!
  field: String!
  fix: String!
}
```

0.40.1 - 2020-11-05
-------------------

Fix mypy plugin to handle bug where the `types` argument to `strawberry.union` is passed in as a keyword argument instead of a position one.

```python
MyUnion = strawberry.union(types=(TypeA, TypeB), name="MyUnion")
```

0.39.2 - 2020-10-29
-------------------

This fixes the prettier pre-lint check.

0.39.1 - 2020-10-28
-------------------

Fix issue when using `strawberry.enum(module.EnumClass)` in mypy

0.39.0 - 2020-10-27
-------------------

This release adds support to mark a field as deprecated via `deprecation_reason`

0.38.1 - 2020-10-27
-------------------

Set default value to null in the schema when it's set to None

0.38.0 - 2020-10-27
-------------------

Register UUID's as a custom scalar type instead of the ID type.

⚠️ This is a potential breaking change because inputs of type UUID are now parsed as instances of uuid.UUID instead of strings as they were before.

0.37.7 - 2020-10-27
-------------------

This release fixes a bug when returning list in async resolvers

0.37.6 - 2020-10-23
-------------------

This release improves how we check for enums

-------------------

This release improves support for strawberry.enums when type checking with mypy.

0.37.1 - 2020-10-20
-------------------

Fix ASGI view to call `get_context` during a websocket request

0.37.0 - 2020-10-18
-------------------

Add support for adding a description to field arguments using the [`Annotated`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Annotated) type:

```python
from typing import Annotated


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def user_by_id(
        id: Annotated[str, strawberry.argument(description="The ID of the user")]
    ) -> User: ...
```

which results in the following schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  userById(
    """The ID of the user"""
    id: String
  ): User!
}
```

**Note:** if you are not using Python v3.9 or greater you will need to import `Annotated` from `typing_extensions`

0.36.4 - 2020-10-17
-------------------

This release adds support for using strawberry.enum as a function with MyPy,
this is now valid typed code:

```python
from enum import Enum

import strawberry


class IceCreamFlavour(Enum):
    VANILLA = "vanilla"
    STRAWBERRY = "strawberry"
    CHOCOLATE = "chocolate"


Flavour = strawberry.enum(IceCreamFlavour)
```

0.36.3 - 2020-10-16
-------------------

0.36.2 - 2020-10-12
-------------------

Extend support for parsing isoformat datetimes,
adding a dependency on the `dateutil` library.
For example: "2020-10-12T22:00:00.000Z"
can now be parsed as a datetime with a UTC timezone.

0.36.1 - 2020-10-11
-------------------

Add `schema.introspect()` method to return introspection result of the schema.
This might be useful for tools like `apollo codegen` or `graphql-voyager` which
expect a full json representation of the schema

0.36.0 - 2020-10-06
-------------------

This releases adds a new extension for OpenTelemetry.

```python
import asyncio

from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import (
    ConsoleSpanExporter,
    SimpleExportSpanProcessor,
)

import strawberry
from strawberry.extensions.tracing import OpenTelemetryExtension


trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider())
trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(
    SimpleExportSpanProcessor(ConsoleSpanExporter())
)


@strawberry.type
class User:
    name: str


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    async def user(self, name: str) -> User:
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
        return User(name)


schema = strawberry.Schema(Query, extensions=[OpenTelemetryExtension])
```

0.35.2 - 2020-10-04
-------------------

This release fixes an issue with the extension runner and async resolvers

0.35.1 - 2020-10-02
-------------------

Fixed bug where you couldn't use the same Union type multiple times in a schema.

0.35.0 - 2020-10-02
-------------------

Added `strawberry.Private` type to mark fields as "private" so they don't show up in the GraphQL schema.

Example:

```python
import strawberry


@strawberry.type
class User:
    age: strawberry.Private[int]

    @strawberry.field
    def age_in_months(self) -> int:
        return self.age * 12
```

class User:
    name: str = strawberry.field(description="Example")
```

0.34.0 - 2020-09-30
-------------------

This release adds support for Apollo Tracing and support for creating Strawberry
extensions, here's how you can enable Apollo tracing:

```python
from strawberry.extensions.tracing import ApolloTracingExtension

schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query, extensions=[ApolloTracingExtension])
```

And here's an example of custom extension:

```python
from strawberry.extensions import Extension


class MyExtension(Extension):
    def get_results(self):
        return {"example": "this is an example for an extension"}


schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query, extensions=[MyExtension])
```

-------------------

This release fixes an issue when trying to print a type
with a UNSET default value

0.33.0 - 2020-09-24
-------------------

* `UnionDefinition` has been renamed to `StrawberryUnion`
* `strawberry.union` now returns an instance of `StrawberryUnion` instead of a
dynamically generated class instance with a `_union_definition` attribute of
type `UnionDefinition`.

0.32.4 - 2020-09-22
-------------------

This release adds the `py.typed` file for better mypy support.

0.32.3 - 2020-09-07
-------------------

This release fixes another issue with extending types.

0.32.2 - 2020-09-07
-------------------

This releases fixes an issue when extending types, now
fields should work as they were working before even
when extending an existing type.

0.32.1 - 2020-09-06
-------------------

Improves tooling by adding `flake8-eradicate` to `flake8` `pre-commit` hook..

0.32.0 - 2020-09-06
-------------------

Previously, `strawberry.field` had redundant arguments for the resolver, one for
when `strawberry.field` was used as a decorator, and one for when it was used as
a function. These are now combined into a single argument.

The `f` argument of `strawberry.field` no longer exists. This is a
backwards-incompatible change, but should not affect many users. The `f`
argument was the first argument for `strawberry.field` and its use was only
documented without the keyword. The fix is very straight-forward: replace any
`f=` kwarg with `resolver=`.

```python
@strawberry.type
class Query:
    my_int: int = strawberry.field(f=lambda: 5)
    # becomes
    my_int: int = strawberry.field(resolver=lambda: 5)

    # no change
    @strawberry.field
    def my_float(self) -> float:
        return 5.5
```

Other (minor) breaking changes
* `MissingArgumentsAnnotationsError`'s message now uses the original Python
field name instead of the GraphQL field name. The error can only be thrown while
instantiating a strawberry.field, so the Python field name should be more
helpful.
* As a result, `strawberry.arguments.get_arguments_from_resolver()` now only
takes one field -- the `resolver` Callable.
* `MissingFieldAnnotationError` is now thrown when a strawberry.field is not
type-annotated but also has no resolver to determine its type

0.31.1 - 2020-08-26
-------------------

This release fixes the Flask view that was returning 400 when there were errors
in the GraphQL results. Now it always returns 200.

0.31.0 - 2020-08-26
-------------------

Add `process_result` to views for Django, Flask and ASGI. They can be overridden
to provide a custom response and also to process results and errors.

It also removes `request` from Flask view's `get_root_value` and `get_context`
since request in Flask is a global.

Django example:

```python
# views.py
from django.http import HttpRequest
from strawberry.django.views import GraphQLView as BaseGraphQLView
from strawberry.http import GraphQLHTTPResponse
from strawberry.types import ExecutionResult


class GraphQLView(BaseGraphQLView):
    def process_result(
        self, request: HttpRequest, result: ExecutionResult
    ) -> GraphQLHTTPResponse:
        return {"data": result.data, "errors": result.errors or []}
```

Flask example:

```python
# views.py
from strawberry.flask.views import GraphQLView as BaseGraphQLView
from strawberry.http import GraphQLHTTPResponse
from strawberry.types import ExecutionResult


class GraphQLView(BaseGraphQLView):
    def process_result(self, result: ExecutionResult) -> GraphQLHTTPResponse:
        return {"data": result.data, "errors": result.errors or []}
```

ASGI example:

```python
from strawberry.asgi import GraphQL as BaseGraphQL
from strawberry.http import GraphQLHTTPResponse
from strawberry.types import ExecutionResult
from starlette.requests import Request

from .schema import schema


class GraphQL(BaseGraphQLView):
    async def process_result(
        self, request: Request, result: ExecutionResult
    ) -> GraphQLHTTPResponse:
        return {"data": result.data, "errors": result.errors or []}
```

0.30.1 - 2020-08-17
-------------------

This releases fixes the check for unset values.

0.30.0 - 2020-08-16
-------------------

Add functions `get_root_value` and `get_context` to views for Django, Flask and
ASGI. They can be overridden to provide custom values per request.

Django example:

```python
# views.py
from strawberry.django.views import GraphQLView as BaseGraphQLView


class GraphQLView(BaseGraphQLView):
    def get_context(self, request):
        return {
            "request": request,
            "custom_context_value": "Hi!",
        }

    def get_root_value(self, request):
        return {
            "custom_root_value": "🍓",
        }


# urls.py
from django.urls import path

from .views import GraphQLView
from .schema import schema

urlpatterns = [
    path("graphql/", GraphQLView.as_view(schema=schema)),
]
```

Flask example:

```python
# views.py
from strawberry.flask.views import GraphQLView as BaseGraphQLView


class GraphQLView(BaseGraphQLView):
    def get_context(self, request):
        return {
            "request": request,
            "custom_context_value": "Hi!",
        }

    def get_root_value(self, request):
        return {
            "custom_root_value": "🍓",
        }


# app.py
from flask import Flask

from .views import GraphQLView
from .schema import schema

app = Flask(__name__)

app.add_url_rule(
    "/graphql",
    view_func=GraphQLView.as_view("graphql_view", schema=schema),
)
```


ASGI example:

```python
# app.py
from strawberry.asgi import GraphQL as BaseGraphQL

from .schema import schema


class GraphQL(BaseGraphQLView):
    async def get_context(self, request):
        return {
            "request": request,
            "custom_context_value": "Hi!",
        }

    async def get_root_value(self, request):
        return {
            "custom_root_value": "🍓",
        }


app = GraphQL(schema)
```

0.29.1 - 2020-08-07
-------------------

Support for `default_value` on inputs.

Usage:
```python
class MyInput:
    s: Optional[str] = None
    i: int = 0
```
```graphql
input MyInput {
  s: String = null
  i: Int! = 0
}
```

0.29.0 - 2020-08-03
-------------------

This release adds support for file uploads within Django.

We follow the following spec: https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec


Example:

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry.file_uploads import Upload


@strawberry.type
class Mutation:
    @strawberry.mutation
    def read_text(self, text_file: Upload) -> str:
        return text_file.read().decode()
```

0.28.5 - 2020-08-01
-------------------

Fix issue when reusing an interface

0.28.4 - 2020-07-28
-------------------

Fix issue when using generic types with federation

0.28.3 - 2020-07-27

represented as GraphQL ID in the GraphQL schema.

0.28.1 - 2020-07-25
-------------------

This release fixes support for PEP-563, now you can safely use `from __future__ import annotations`,
like the following example:


```python
from __future__ import annotations


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    me: MyType = strawberry.field(name="myself")


@strawberry.type
class MyType:
    id: strawberry.ID
```

0.28.0 - 2020-07-24
-------------------

This releases brings a much needed internal refactor of how we generate
GraphQL types from class definitions. Hopefully this will make easier to
extend Strawberry in future.

There are some internal breaking changes, so if you encounter any issue
let us know and well try to help with the migration.

In addition to the internal refactor we also fixed some bugs and improved
the public api for the schema class. Now you can run queries directly
on the schema by running `schema.execute`, `schema.execute_sync` and
`schema.subscribe` on your schema.

0.27.5 - 2020-07-22
-------------------

Add websocket object to the subscription context.

0.27.4 - 2020-07-14

0.27.2 - 2020-06-11
-------------------

This release fixes an issue when using named union types in generic types,
for example using an optional union. This is now properly supported:


```python
@strawberry.type
class A:
    a: int


@strawberry.type
class B:
    b: int


Result = strawberry.union("Result", (A, B))


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    ab: Optional[Result] = None
```

0.27.1 - 2020-06-11
-------------------

Fix typo in Decimal description

0.27.0 - 2020-06-10
-------------------

This release adds support for decimal type, example:


```python
@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def example_decimal(self) -> Decimal:
        return Decimal("3.14159")
```

0.26.3 - 2020-06-10

    pass
```

0.26.0 - 2020-05-21
-------------------

This releases adds experimental support for apollo federation.

Here's an example:

```python

@strawberry.federation.type(extend=True, keys=["id"])
class Campaign:
    id: strawberry.ID = strawberry.federation.field(external=True)

    @strawberry.field
    def title(self) -> str:
        return f"Title for {self.id}"

    @classmethod
    def resolve_reference(cls, id):
        return Campaign(id)


@strawberry.federation.type(extend=True)
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def strawberry(self) -> str:
        return "🍓"


schema = strawberry.federation.Schema(query=Query, types=[Campaign])
```

0.25.6 - 2020-05-19
-------------------

Default values make input arguments nullable when the default is None.
```python
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def hello(self, i: int = 0, s: str = None) -> str:
        return s
```
```graphql
type Query {
  hello(i: Int! = 0, s: String): String!

  s: String
  i: Int! = 0
}
```

0.25.3 - 2020-05-17

-------------------

Fix error when a subscription accepted input arguments

0.25.0 - 2020-05-05
-------------------

This release add supports for named unions, now you can create
a new union type by writing:

```python
Result = strawberry.union("Result", (A, B), description="Example Result")
```

This also improves the support for Union and Generic types, as it
was broken before.

0.24.1 - 2020-04-29
-------------------

This release fixes a bug introduced by 0.24.0

0.24.0 - 2020-04-29
-------------------

This releases allows to use resolver without having
to specify root and info arguments:

```python
def function_resolver() -> str:
    return "I'm a function resolver"


def function_resolver_with_params(x: str) -> str:
    return f"I'm {x}"


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    hello: str = strawberry.field(resolver=function_resolver)
    hello_with_params: str = strawberry.field(resolver=function_resolver_with_params)


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def hello(self) -> str:
        return "I'm a function resolver"

    @strawberry.field
    def hello_with_params(self, x: str) -> str:
        return f"I'm {x}"

to reuse types, here's an example:

```python
T = typing.TypeVar("T")


@strawberry.type
class Edge(typing.Generic[T]):
    cursor: strawberry.ID
    node: T


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def int_edge(self, info, **kwargs) -> Edge[int]:

from your_project.schema import schema

app = Flask(__name__)

app.add_url_rule(
    "/graphql", view_func=GraphQLView.as_view("graphql_view", schema=schema)
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

0.20.3 - 2020-02-11
-------------------

Improve datetime, date and time types conversion. Removes aniso dependency

-------------------

This release improves support for permissions (it is a breaking change).
Now you will receive the source and the arguments in the `has_permission` method,
so you can run more complex permission checks. It also allows to use permissions
on fields, here's an example:


```python
import strawberry

from strawberry.permission import BasePermission


class IsAdmin(BasePermission):
    message = "You are not authorized"

    def has_permission(self, source, info):
        return source.name.lower() == "Patrick" or _is_admin(info)


@strawberry.type
class User:
    name: str
    email: str = strawberry.field(permission_classes=[IsAdmin])


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field(permission_classes=[IsAdmin])
    def user(self, info) -> str:
        return User(name="Patrick", email="example@email.com")
```

0.19.1 - 2019-12-20
-------------------

This releases removes support for async resolver in django
as they causes issues when accessing the databases.

0.19.0 - 2019-12-19
-------------------

This release improves support for django and asgi integration.

It allows to use async resolvers when using django. It also changes the status
code from 400 to 200 even if there are errors this makes it possible to still
use other fields even if one raised an error.

We also moved strawberry.contrib.django to strawberry.django, so if you're using
the django view make sure you update the paths.

-------------------

Added support for defining query directives, example:

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry.directive import DirectiveLocation


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    cake: str = "made_in_switzerland"


@strawberry.directive(
    locations=[DirectiveLocation.FIELD], description="Make string uppercase"
)
def uppercase(value: str, example: str):
    return value.upper()

query = """
mutation {
    hello {
        __typename

        ... on A {
            x
        }

        ... on B {

        }
    }
}
"""
```

    hello(name: String = "world"): String
}
```

0.10.0 - 2019-05-28

    id: InitVar[str]


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def category(self, info) -> Category:
