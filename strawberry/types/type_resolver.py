    This function returns a list of StrawberryFields (one for each field item), while
    also paying attention the name and typing of the field.

    StrawberryFields can be defined on a strawberry.type class as either a dataclass-
    style field or using strawberry.field as a decorator.

    >>> import strawberry
    >>> @strawberry.type
    ... class Query:
    ...     type_1a: int = 5
    ...     type_1b: int = strawberry.field(...)
    ...     type_1c: int = strawberry.field(resolver=...)
    ...
    ...     @strawberry.field
    ...     def type_2(self) -> int:
    ...         ...

    Type #1:
        A pure dataclass-style field. Will not have a StrawberryField; one will need to
        be created in this function. Type annotation is required.

    Type #2:
        A field defined using @strawberry.field as a decorator around the resolver. The
        resolver must be type-annotated.

    The StrawberryField.python_name value will be assigned to the field's name on the
    class if one is not set by either using an explicit strawberry.field(name=...) or by
    passing a named function (i.e. not an anonymous lambda) to strawberry.field
    (typically as a decorator).
