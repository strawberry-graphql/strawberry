# Channels

Strawberry provides support for [Channels](https://channels.readthedocs.io/)
with
[Consumers](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/topics/consumers.html) to
provide GraphQL support over WebSockets and HTTP.

## Introduction

While Channels does require Django to be installed as a dependency, you can
actually run this integration without using Django's request handler. However,
the most common use case will be to run a normal Django project with GraphQL
subscriptions support, typically taking advantage of the Channel Layers
functionality which is exposed through the Strawberry integration.

---

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

Make sure you have read the following Channels documentation:

- [Introduction](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction.html#)
- [Tutorial](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/index.html)
- [Consumers](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/topics/consumers.html)
- And our [Subscriptions](../general/subscriptions) documentation.

If you have read the Channels documentation, You should know by now that:

1. ASGI application is a callable that can handle multiple send / receive
   operations without the need of a new application instance.
2. Channels is all about making ASGI applications instances (whether in another
   processes or in another machine) talk to each other seamlessly.
3. A `scope` is a single connection represented by a dict, whether it would be a
   websocket or an HTTP request or another protocol.
4. A `Consumer` is an ASGI application abstraction that helps to handle a single
   scope.

### Installation

Before using Strawberry's Channels support, make sure you install all the
required dependencies by running:

```shell
pip install 'strawberry-graphql[channels]'
```

---

## Tutorial

_The following example will pick up where the Channels tutorials left off._

By the end of this tutorial, You will have a graphql chat subscription that will
be able to talk with the channels chat consumer from the tutorial.

### Types setup

First, let's create some Strawberry-types for the chat.

```python
# mysite/gqlchat/subscription.py

import strawberry


@strawberry.input
class ChatRoom:
    room_name: str


@strawberry.type
class ChatRoomMessage:
    room_name: str
    current_user: str
    message: str
```

### Channel Layers

The Context for Channels integration includes the consumer, which has an
instance of the channel layer and the consumer's channel name. This tutorial is
an example of how this can be used in the schema to provide subscriptions to
events generated by background tasks or the web server. Even if these are
executed in other threads, processes, or even other servers, if you are using a
Layer backend like Redis or RabbitMQ you should receive the events.

To set this up, you'll need to make sure Channel Layers is configured as per the
[documentation](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/topics/channel_layers.html).

Then you'll want to add a subscription that accesses the channel layer and joins
one or more broadcast groups.

Since listening for events and passing them along to the client is a common use
case, the base consumer provides a high level API for that using a generator
pattern, as we will see below.

### The chat subscription

Now we will create the chat [subscription](../general/subscriptions.md).

```python
# mysite/gqlchat/subscription.py

import os
import threading

from typing import AsyncGenerator, List

from strawberry.types import Info


@strawberry.type
class Subscription:
    @strawberry.subscription
    async def join_chat_rooms(
        self,
        info: Info,
        rooms: List[ChatRoom],
        user: str,
    ) -> AsyncGenerator[ChatRoomMessage, None]:
        """Join and subscribe to message sent to the given rooms."""
        ws = info.context["ws"]
        channel_layer = ws.channel_layer

        room_ids = [f"chat_{room.room_name}" for room in rooms]

        for room in room_ids:
            # Join room group
            await channel_layer.group_add(room, ws.channel_name)

        for room in room_ids:
            await channel_layer.group_send(
                room,
                {
                    "type": "chat.message",
                    "room_id": room,
                    "message": f"process: {os.getpid()} thread: {threading.current_thread().name}"
                    f" -> Hello my name is {user}!",
                },
            )

        async with ws.listen_to_channel("chat.message", groups=room_ids) as cm:
            async for message in cm:
                if message["room_id"] in room_ids:
                    yield ChatRoomMessage(
                        room_name=message["room_id"],
                        message=message["message"],
                        current_user=user,
                    )
```

Explanation: `Info.context["ws"]` or `Info.context["request"]` is a pointer to the
[`ChannelsConsumer`](#channelsconsumer) instance. Here we have first sent a
message to all the channel_layer groups (specified in the subscription argument
`rooms`) that we have joined the chat.

<Note>

The `ChannelsConsumer` instance is shared between all subscriptions created in
a single websocket connection. The `ws.listen_to_channel` context manager will return
a function to yield all
messages sent using the given message `type` (`chat.message` in the above example)
but does not ensure that the message was sent to the same group or groups that
it was called with - if another subscription using the same `ChannelsConsumer`
also uses `ws.listen_to_channel` with some other group names, those will be returned
as well.

In the example we ensure `message["room_id"] in room_ids` before passing messages
on to the subscription client to ensure subscriptions only receive messages for
the chat rooms requested in that subscription.

</Note>

<Note>

We do not need to call `await channel_layer.group_add(room, ws.channel_name)` if
we don't want to send an initial message while instantiating the subscription.
It is handled by `ws.listen_to_channel`.

</Note>

### Chat message mutation

If you noticed, the subscription client can't send a message willingly. You will
have to create a mutation for sending messages via the `channel_layer`

```python
# mysite/gqlchat/subscription.py

from channels.layers import get_channel_layer


@strawberry.type
class Mutation:
    @strawberry.mutation
    async def send_chat_message(
        self,
        info: Info,
        room: ChatRoom,
        message: str,
    ) -> None:
        channel_layer = get_channel_layer()

        await channel_layer.group_send(
            f"chat_{room.room_name}",
            {
                "type": "chat.message",
                "room_id": f"chat_{room.room_name}",
                "message": message,
            },
        )
```

### Creating the consumers

All we did so far is useless without creating an asgi consumer for our schema.
The easiest way to do that is to use the
[`GraphQLProtocolTypeRouter`](#graphqlprotocoltyperouter) which will wrap your
Django application, and route **HTTP and websockets** for `"/graphql"` to
Strawberry, while sending all other requests to Django. You'll need to modify
the `myproject.asgi.py` file from the Channels instructions to look something
like this:

```python
import os

from django.core.asgi import get_asgi_application
from strawberry.channels import GraphQLProtocolTypeRouter

os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "mysite.settings")
django_asgi_app = get_asgi_application()

# Import your Strawberry schema after creating the django ASGI application
# This ensures django.setup() has been called before any ORM models are imported
# for the schema.
from mysite.graphql import schema


application = GraphQLProtocolTypeRouter(
    schema,
    django_application=django_asgi_app,
)
```

This approach is not very flexible, taking away some useful capabilities of
Channels. For more complex deployments, i.e you want to integrate several ASGI
applications on different URLs and protocols, like what is described in the
[Channels documentation](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/topics/protocols.html).
You will probably craft your own
[`ProtocolTypeRouter`](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/topics/routing.html#protocoltyperouter).

An example of this (continuing from channels tutorial) would be:

```python
import os

from channels.auth import AuthMiddlewareStack
from channels.routing import ProtocolTypeRouter, URLRouter
from django.core.asgi import get_asgi_application
from django.urls import re_path
from strawberry.channels import GraphQLHTTPConsumer, GraphQLWSConsumer

os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "berry.settings")
django_asgi_app = get_asgi_application()

# Import your Strawberry schema after creating the django ASGI application
# This ensures django.setup() has been called before any ORM models are imported
# for the schema.

from chat import routing
from mysite.graphql import schema


gql_http_consumer = AuthMiddlewareStack(GraphQLHTTPConsumer.as_asgi(schema=schema))
gql_ws_consumer = GraphQLWSConsumer.as_asgi(schema=schema)

websocket_urlpatterns = routing.websocket_urlpatterns + [
    re_path(r"graphql", gql_ws_consumer),
]

application = ProtocolTypeRouter(
    {
        "http": URLRouter(
            [
                re_path("^graphql", gql_http_consumer),
                re_path(
                    "^", django_asgi_app
                ),  # This might be another endpoint in your app
            ]
        ),
        "websocket": AuthMiddlewareStack(URLRouter(websocket_urlpatterns)),
    }
)
```

This example demonstrates some ways that Channels can be set up to handle
routing. A very common scenario will be that you want user and session
information inside the GraphQL context, which the AuthMiddlewareStack wrapper
above will provide. It might be apparent by now, there's no reason at all why
you couldn't run a Channels server without any Django ASGI application at all.
However, take care to ensure you run `django.setup()` instead of
`get_asgi_application()`, if you need any Django ORM or other Django features in
Strawberry.

### Running our example

First run your asgi application _(The ProtocolTypeRouter)_ using your asgi
server. If you are coming from the channels tutorial, there is no difference.
Then open three different tabs on your browser and go to the following URLs:

1. `localhost:8000/graphql`
2. `localhost:8000/graphql`
3. `localhost:8000/chat`

If you want, you can run 3 different instances of your application with
different ports it should work the same!

On tab #1 start the subscription:

```graphql
subscription SubscribeToChatRooms {
  joinChatRooms(
    rooms: [{ roomName: "room1" }, { roomName: "room2" }]
    user: "foo"
  ) {
    roomName
    message
    currentUser
  }
}
```

On tab #2 we will run `sendChatMessage` mutation:

```graphql
mutation echo {
  sendChatMessage(message: "hello room 1", room: { roomName: "room1" })
}
```

On tab #3 we will join the room you subscribed to ("room1") and start chatting.
Before we do that there is a slight change we need to make in the `ChatConsumer`
you created with channels in order to make it compatible with our
`ChatRoomMessage` type.

```python
# Send message to room group
await self.channel_layer.group_send(
    self.room_group_name,
    {
        "type": "chat.message",
        "room_id": self.room_group_name,  # <<< here is the change
        "message": f"process is {os.getpid()}, Thread is {threading.current_thread().name}"
        f" -> {message}",
    },
)
```

Look here for some more complete examples:

1. The
   [Strawberry Examples repo](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/examples)
   contains a basic example app demonstrating subscriptions with Channels.

### Confirming GraphQL Subscriptions

By default no confirmation message is sent to the GraphQL client once the
subscription has started. However, this is useful to be able to synchronize
actions and detect communication errors. The code below shows how the above
example can be adapted to send a null from the server to the client to confirm
that the subscription has successfully started. This includes confirming that
the Channels layer subscription has started.

```python
# mysite/gqlchat/subscription.py


@strawberry.type
class Subscription:
    @strawberry.subscription
    async def join_chat_rooms(
        self,
        info: Info,
        rooms: List[ChatRoom],
        user: str,
    ) -> AsyncGenerator[ChatRoomMessage | None, None]:
        ...
        async with ws.listen_to_channel("chat.message", groups=room_ids) as cm:
            yield None
            async for message in cm:
                if message["room_id"] in room_ids:
                    yield ChatRoomMessage(
                        room_name=message["room_id"],
                        message=message["message"],
                        current_user=user,
                    )
```

Note the change in return signature for `join_chat_rooms` and the `yield None`
after entering the `listen_to_channel` context manger.

## Testing

We provide a minimal application communicator (`GraphQLWebsocketCommunicator`) for subscribing.
Here is an example based on the tutorial above: _Make sure you have pytest-async
installed_

```python
from channels.testing import WebsocketCommunicator
import pytest
from myapp.asgi import application  # your channels asgi
from strawberry.channels.testing import GraphQLWebsocketCommunicator


@pytest.fixture
async def gql_communicator() -> GraphQLWebsocketCommunicator:
    client = GraphQLWebsocketCommunicator(application=application, path="/graphql")
    await client.gql_init()
    yield client
    await client.disconnect()


chat_subscription_query = """
                subscription fooChat {
                joinChatRooms(
                    rooms: [{ roomName: "room1" }, { roomName: "room2" }]
                    user: "foo"){
                        roomName
                        message
                        currentUser
                    }
                }
"""


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_joinChatRooms_sends_welcome_message(gql_communicator):
    async for result in gql_communicator.subscribe(query=chat_subscription_query):
        data = result.data
        assert data["currentUser"] == "foo"
        assert "room1" in data["roomName"]
        assert "hello" in data["message"]
```

In order to test a real server connection we can use python
[gql client](https://github.com/graphql-python/gql) and channels
[`ChannelsLiveServerTestCase`](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/testing.html#channelsliveservertestcase).

<Note>

This example is based on the extended `ChannelsLiveServerTestCase` class from
channels tutorial part 4. **You cannot run this test with a pytest session.**

</Note>

Add this test in your `ChannelsLiveServerTestCase` extended class:

```python
from gql import Client, gql
from gql.transport.websockets import WebsocketsTransport


def test_send_message_via_channels_chat_joinChatRooms_recieves(self):
    transport = WebsocketsTransport(url=self.live_server_ws_url + "/graphql")

    client = Client(
        transport=transport,
        fetch_schema_from_transport=False,
    )

    query = gql(chat_subscription_query)
    for index, result in enumerate(client.subscribe(query)):
        if index == 0 or 1:
            print(result)
        # because we subscribed to 2 rooms we received two welcome messages.
        elif index == 2:
            print(result)
            assert "hello from web browser" in result["joinChatRooms"]["message"]
            break

        try:
            self._enter_chat_room("room1")
            self._post_message("hello from web browser")
        finally:
            self._close_all_new_windows()
```

---

The HTTP and WebSockets protocol are handled by different base classes. HTTP uses
`GraphQLHTTPConsumer` and WebSockets uses `GraphQLWSConsumer`. Both of them can
be extended:

## GraphQLHTTPConsumer (HTTP)

### Options

`GraphQLHTTPConsumer` supports the same options as all other integrations:

- `schema`: mandatory, the schema created by `strawberry.Schema`.
- `graphql_ide`: optional, defaults to `"graphiql"`, allows to choose the GraphQL IDE interface (one of `graphiql`, `apollo-sandbox` or `pathfinder`) or to disable it by passing `None`.
- `allow_queries_via_get`: optional, defaults to `True`, whether to enable
  queries via `GET` requests
- `subscriptions_enabled`: optional boolean paramenter enabling subscriptions in
  the GraphiQL interface, defaults to `True`

### Extending the consumer

We allow to extend `GraphQLHTTPConsumer`, by overriding the following methods:

- `async def get_context(self, request: ChannelsRequest, response: TemporalResponse) -> Context`
- `async def get_root_value(self, request: ChannelsRequest) -> Optional[RootValue]`
- `async def process_result(self, request: Request, result: ExecutionResult) -> GraphQLHTTPResponse:`.

### Context

The default context returned by `get_context()` is a `dict` that includes the following keys by default:

- `request`: A `ChannelsRequest` object with the following fields and methods:
  - `consumer`: The `GraphQLHTTPConsumer` instance for this connection
  - `body`: The request body
  - `headers`: A dict containing the headers of the request
  - `method`: The HTTP method of the request
  - `content_type`: The content type of the request
- `response` A `TemporalResponse` object, that can be used to influence the HTTP response:
  - `status_code`: The status code of the response, if there are no execution errors (defaults to `200`)
  - `headers`: Any additional headers that should be send with the response

## GraphQLWSConsumer (WebSockets / Subscriptions)

### Options

- `schema`: mandatory, the schema created by `strawberry.Schema`.
- `debug`: optional, defaults to `False`, whether to enable debug mode.
- `keep_alive`: optional, defaults to `False`, whether to enable keep alive mode
  for websockets.
- `keep_alive_interval`: optional, defaults to `1`, the interval in seconds for
  keep alive messages.

### Extending the consumer

We allow to extend `GraphQLWSConsumer`, by overriding the following methods:

- `async def get_context(self, request: ChannelsConsumer, connection_params: Any) -> Context`
- `async def get_root_value(self, request: ChannelsConsumer) -> Optional[RootValue]`

### Context

The default context returned by `get_context()` is a `dict` and it includes the following keys by default:

- `request`: The `GraphQLWSConsumer` instance of the current connection. It can be used to access the connection
  scope, e.g. `info.context["ws"].headers` allows access to any headers.
- `ws`: The same as `request`
- `connection_params`: Any `connection_params`, see [Authenticating Subscriptions](/docs/general/subscriptions#authenticating-subscriptions)

## Example for defining a custom context

Here is an example for extending the base classes to offer a different context object in your resolvers.
For the HTTP integration, you can also have properties to access the current user and the
session. Both properties depend on the `AuthMiddlewareStack` wrapper.

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import AnonymousUser

from strawberry.channels import ChannelsConsumer, ChannelsRequest
from strawberry.channels import GraphQLHTTPConsumer as BaseGraphQLHTTPConsumer
from strawberry.channels import GraphQLWSConsumer as BaseGraphQLWSConsumer
from strawberry.http.temporal_response import TemporalResponse


@dataclass
class ChannelsContext:
    request: ChannelsRequest
    response: TemporalResponse

    @property
    def user(self):
        # Depends on Channels' AuthMiddlewareStack
        if "user" in self.request.consumer.scope:
            return self.request.consumer.scope["user"]

        return AnonymousUser()

    @property
    def session(self):
        # Depends on Channels' SessionMiddleware / AuthMiddlewareStack
        if "session" in self.request.consumer.scope:
            return self.request.consumer.scope["session"]

        return None


@dataclass
class ChannelsWSContext:
    request: ChannelsConsumer
    connection_params: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None

    @property
    def ws(self) -> ChannelsConsumer:
        return self.request


class GraphQLHTTPConsumer(BaseGraphQLHTTPConsumer):
    @override
    async def get_context(
        self, request: ChannelsRequest, response: TemporalResponse
    ) -> ChannelsContext:
        return ChannelsContext(
            request=request,
            response=response,
        )


class GraphQLWSConsumer(BaseGraphQLWSConsumer):
    @override
    async def get_context(
        self, request: ChannelsConsumer, connection_params: Any
    ) -> ChannelsWSContext:
        return ChannelsWSContext(
            request=request,
            connection_params=connection_params,
        )
```

You can import and use the extended `GraphQLHTTPConsumer` and `GraphQLWSConsumer` classes in your
`myproject.asgi.py` file as shown before.

## API

### GraphQLProtocolTypeRouter

A helper for creating a common strawberry-django
[`ProtocolTypeRouter`](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/topics/routing.html#protocoltyperouter)
Implementation.

Example usage:

```python
from strawberry.channels import GraphQLProtocolTypeRouter
from django.core.asgi import get_asgi_application

django_asgi = get_asgi_application()

from myapi import schema

application = GraphQLProtocolTypeRouter(
    schema,
    django_application=django_asgi,
)
```

This will route all requests to /graphql on either HTTP or websockets to us, and
everything else to the Django application.

### ChannelsConsumer

Strawberries extended [`AsyncConsumer`](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/topics/consumers.html#consumers).

Every graphql session will have an instance of this class inside `info.context["ws"]` (WebSockets) or `info.context["request"].consumer` (HTTP).

#### properties

```python
@contextlib.asynccontextmanager
async def listen_to_channel(
    self,
    type: str,
    *,
    timeout: float | None = None,
    groups: Sequence[str] | None = None
) -> AsyncGenerator[Any, None]:
    ...
```

- `type` - The type of the message to wait for, equivalent to `scope['type']`
- `timeout` - An optional timeout to wait for each subsequent message.
- `groups` - list of groups to yield messages from threw channel layer.
