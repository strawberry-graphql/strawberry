# Permissions

Permissions can be managed using `Permission` classes. A `Permission` class
extends `BasePermission` and has a `has_permission` method. It can be added to a
field using the `permission_classes` keyword argument. A basic example looks
like this:

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry.permission import BasePermission
from strawberry.types import Info

class IsAuthenticated(BasePermission):
    message = "User is not authenticated"

    def has_permission(self, source: Any, info: Info, **kwargs) -> bool:
        return False

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    user: str = strawberry.field(permission_classes=[IsAuthenticated])
```

Your `has_permission` method should do the work to check if this request
has permission to the field. If the `has_permission` method returns `True` or
a truthy value then the field access will go ahead. If the `has_permission`
method returns `False` or a falsy value then an error will be raised using
the `message` class attribute. See [Dealing with Errors](/docs/guides/errors)
for more information on how errors are handled.

```json
{
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "User is not authenticated"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Accessing user information

Accessing the current user information to implement your permission checks
depends on the web framework you are using. Most frameworks will have a
`Request` object where you can either access the current user directly or access
headers/cookies/query parameters to authenticate the user. All the Strawberry
integrations provide this Request object in the `info.context` object that is
accessible in every resolver and in the `has_permission` function. You can find
more details about a specific framework integration under the "Integrations"
heading in the navigation.

In this example we are using `starlette` which uses the
[ASGI](/docs/integrations/asgi) integration:

```python
from myauth import authenticate_header, authenticate_query_param

from starlette.requests import Request
from starlette.websockets import WebSocket

class IsAuthenticated(BasePermission):
    message = "User is not authenticated"

    def has_permission(self, source: Any, info: Info, **kwargs) -> bool:
        request: Union[Request, Websocket] = info.context["request"]
        if "Authorization" in request.headers:
            return authenticate_header(request)
        if "auth" in request.query_params:
            return authenticate_query_params(request)
        return False
```

Here we retrieve the `request` object from the `context` provided by `info`.
This object will be either a `Request` or `Websocket` instance from `starlette`
(see: [Request docs](https://www.starlette.io/requests/) and
[Websocket docs](https://www.starlette.io/websockets/)).

In the next step we take either the `Authorization` header or the `auth` query
parameter out of the `request` object, depending on which is available. We then
pass those on to some authenticate methods we've implemented ourselves.

Beyond providing hooks, Authentication is not currently Strawberry's
responsibility. You should provide your own helpers to figure out if a request
has the permissions you expect.
