# Relay Guide

## What is Relay?

The relay spec defines some interfaces that GraphQL servers can follow to allow
clients to interact with them in a more efficient way. The spec makes two
core assumptions about a GraphQL server:

1. It provides a mechanism for refetching an object
2. It provides a description of how to page through connections.

You can read more about the relay spec
[here](https://relay.dev/docs/guides/graphql-server-specification/).

### Relay implementation example

Suppose we have the following type:

```python
@strawberry.type
class Fruit:
    name: str
    weight: str
```

We want it to have a globally unique ID, a way to retrieve a paginated results
list of it and a way to refetch if if necessary. For that, we need to inherit it
from the `Node` interface, annotate its attribute that will be used for `GlobalID`
generation with `relay.NodeID` and implement its `resolve_nodes` abstract method.

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry import relay


@strawberry.type
class Fruit(relay.Node):
    code: relay.NodeID[int]
    name: str
    weight: float

    @classmethod
    def resolve_nodes(
        cls,
        *,
        info: Info,
        node_ids: Iterable[str],
        required: bool = False,
    ):
        return [
            all_fruits[int(nid)] if required else all_fruits.get(nid)
            for nid in node_ids
        ]


# In this example, assume we have a dict mapping the fruits code to the Fruit
# object itself
all_fruits: Dict[int, Fruit]
```

Explaining what we did here:

- We annotated `code` using `relay.NodeID[int]`. This makes `code` a
  [Private](../types/private.md) type, which will not be exposed to the
  GraphQL API, and also tells the `Node` interface that it should use
  its value to generate its `id: GlobalID!` for the `Fruit` type.

- We also implemented the `resolve_nodes` abstract method. This method is
  responsible for retrieving the `Fruit` instances given its `id`. Because
  `code` is our id, `node_ids` will be a list of codes as a string.

<Note>

The `GlobalID` gets generated by getting the base64 encoded version of the
string `<TypeName>:<NodeID>`. In the example above, the `Fruit` with a code
of `1` would have its `GlobalID` as `base64("Fruit:1")` = `RnJ1aXQ6MQ==`

</Note>

Now we can expose it in the schema for retrieval and pagination like:

```python
@strawberry.type
class Query:
    node: relay.Node = relay.node()

    @relay.connection(relay.ListConnection[Fruit])
    def fruits(self) -> Iterable[Fruit]:
        # This can be a database query, a generator, an async generator, etc
        return all_fruits.values()
```

This will generate a schema like this:

```graphql
scalar GlobalID

interface Node {
  id: GlobalID!
}

type PageInfo {
  hasNextPage: Boolean!
  hasPreviousPage: Boolean!
  startCursor: String
  endCursor: String
}

type Fruit implements Node {
  id: GlobalID!
  name: String!
  weight: Float!
}

type FruitEdge {
  cursor: String!
  node: Fruit!
}

type FruitConnection {
  pageInfo: PageInfo!
  edges: [FruitEdge!]!
}

type Query {
  node(id: GlobalID!): Node!
  fruits(
    before: String = null
    after: String = null
    first: Int = null
    last: Int = null
  ): FruitConnection!
}
```

With only that we have a way to query `node` to retrieve any `Node` implemented
type in our schema (which includes our `Fruit` type), and also a way to retrieve
a list of fruits with pagination.

For example, to retrieve a single fruit given its unique ID:

```graphql
query {
  node(id: "<some id>") {
    id
    ... on Fruit {
      name
      weight
    }
  }
}
```

Or to retrieve the first 10 fruits available:

```graphql
query {
  fruits(first: 10) {
    pageInfo {
      firstCursor
      endCursor
      hasNextPage
      hasPreviousPage
    }
    edges {
      # node here is the Fruit type
      node {
        id
        name
        weight
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The connection resolver for `relay.ListConnection` should return one of those:

- `List[<NodeType>]`
- `Iterator[<NodeType>]`
- `Iterable[<NodeType>]`
- `AsyncIterator[<NodeType>]`
- `AsyncIterable[<NodeType>]`
- `Generator[<NodeType>, Any, Any]`
- `AsyncGenerator[<NodeType>, Any]`

### The node field

As demonstrated above, the `Node` field can be used to retrieve/refetch any
object in the schema that implements the `Node` interface.

It can be defined in in the `Query` objects in 4 ways:

- `node: Node`: This will define a field that accepts a `GlobalID!` and returns
  a `Node` instance. This is the most basic way to define it.
- `node: Optional[Node]`: The same as `Node`, but if the given object doesn't
  exist, it will return `null`.
- `node: List[Node]`: This will define a field that accepts `[GlobalID!]!` and
  returns a list of `Node` instances. They can even be from different types.
- `node: List[Optional[Node]]`: The same as `List[Node]`, but the returned list
  can contain `null` values if the given objects don't exist.

### Custom connection pagination

The default `relay.Connection` class don't implement any pagination logic, and
should be used as a base class to implement your own pagination logic. All you
need to do is implement the `resolve_connection` classmethod.

The integration provides `relay.ListConnection`, which implements a limit/offset
approach to paginate the results. This is a basic approach and might be enough
for most use cases.

<Note>

`relay.ListConnection` implementes the limit/offset by using slices. That means
that you can override what the slice does by customizing the `__getitem__`
method of the object returned by your nodes resolver.

For example, when working with `Django`, `resolve_nodes` can return a `QuerySet`,
meaning that the slice on it will translate to a `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` in the SQL
query, which will fetch only the data that is needed from the database.

Also note that if that object doesn't have a `__getitem__` attribute, it will
use `itertools.islice` to paginate it, meaning that when a generator is being
resolved it will only generate as much results as needed for the given pagination,
the worst case scenario being the last results needing to be returned.

</Note>

Now, suppose we want to implement a custom cursor-based pagination for our
previous example. We can do something like this:

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry import relay


@strawberry.type
class FruitCustomPaginationConnection(relay.Connection[Fruit]):
    @classmethod
    def resolve_connection(
        cls,
        nodes: Iterable[Fruit],
        *,
        info: Optional[Info] = None,
        before: Optional[str] = None,
        after: Optional[str] = None,
        first: Optional[int] = None,
        last: Optional[int] = None,
    ):
        # NOTE: This is a showcase implementation and is far from
        # being optimal performance wise
        edges_mapping = {
            relay.to_base64("fruit_name", n.name): relay.Edge(
                node=n,
                cursor=relay.to_base64("fruit_name", n.name),
            )
            for n in sorted(nodes, key=lambda f: f.name)
        }
        edges = list(edges_mapping.values())
        first_edge = edges[0] if edges else None
        last_edge = edges[-1] if edges else None

        if after is not None:
            after_edge_idx = edges.index(edges_mapping[after])
            edges = [e for e in edges if edges.index(e) > after_edge_idx]

        if before is not None:
            before_edge_idx = edges.index(edges_mapping[before])
            edges = [e for e in edges if edges.index(e) < before_edge_idx]

        if first is not None:
            edges = edges[:first]

        if last is not None:
            edges = edges[-last:]

        return cls(
            edges=edges,
            page_info=strawberry.relay.PageInfo(
                start_cursor=edges[0].cursor if edges else None,
                end_cursor=edges[-1].cursor if edges else None,
                has_previous_page=(
                    first_edge is not None and bool(edges) and edges[0] != first_edge
                ),
                has_next_page=(
                    last_edge is not None and bool(edges) and edges[-1] != last_edge
                ),
            ),
        )


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    fruits: FruitCustomPaginationConnection
```

In the example above we specialized the `FruitCustomPaginationConnection` by
inheriting it from `relay.Connection[Fruit]`. We could still keep it generic by
inheriting it from `relay.Connection[relay.NodeType]` and then specialize it
when defining the field, making it possible to use our custom pagination logic
with more than one type.

### Custom connection arguments

By default the connection will automatically insert some arguments for it
to be able to paginate the results. Those are:

- `before`: Returns the items in the list that come before the specified cursor
- `after`: Returns the items in the list that come after the " "specified cursor
- `first`: Returns the first n items from the list
- `last`: Returns the items in the list that come after the " "specified cursor

You can still define extra arguments to be used by your own resolver or
custom pagination logic. For example, suppose we want to return the pagination
of all fruits whose name starts with a given string. We could do that like this:

```python
@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @relay.connection(relay.ListConnection[Fruit])
    def fruits_with_filter(
        self,
        info: Info,
        name_endswith: str,
    ) -> Iterable[Fruit]:
        for f in fruits.values():
            if f.name.endswith(name_endswith):
                yield f
```

This will generate a schema like this:

```graphql
type Query {
  fruitsWithFilter(
    nameEndswith: String!
    before: String = null
    after: String = null
    first: Int = null
    last: Int = null
  ): FruitConnection!
}
```

### Convert the node to its proper type when resolving the connection

The connection expects that the resolver will return a list of objects that is
a subclass of its `NodeType`. But there may be situations where you are resolving
something that needs to be converted to the proper type, like an ORM model.

In this case you can subclass the `relay.Connection`/`relay.ListConnection`
and provide a custom `resolve_node` method to it, which by default returns
the node as is. For example:

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry import relay

from db import models


@strawberry.type
class Fruit(relay.Node):
    code: relay.NodeID[int]
    name: str
    weight: float


@strawberry.type
class FruitDBConnection(relay.ListConnection[Fruit]):
    @classmethod
    def resolve_node(cls, node: FruitDB, *, info: Info, **kwargs) -> Fruit:
        return Fruit(
            code=node.code,
            name=node.name,
            weight=node.weight,
        )


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @relay.connection(FruitDBConnection)
    def fruits_with_filter(
        self,
        info: Info,
        name_endswith: str,
    ) -> Iterable[models.Fruit]:
        return models.Fruit.objects.filter(name__endswith=name_endswith)
```

The main advantage of this approach instead of converting it inside the custom
resolver is that the `Connection` will paginate the `QuerySet` first, which in
case of django will make sure that only the paginated results are fetched from the
database. After that, the `resolve_node` function will be called for each result
to retrieve the correct object for it.

We used django for this example, but the same applies to any other other
similar use case, like SQLAlchemy, etc.

### The GlobalID scalar

The `GlobalID` scalar is a special object that contains all the info necessary to
identify and retrieve a given object that implements the `Node` interface.

It can for example be useful in a mutation, to receive and object and retrieve
it in its resolver. For example:

```python
@strawberry.type
class Mutation:
    @strawberry.mutation
    async def update_fruit_weight(
        self,
        info: Info,
        id: relay.GlobalID,
        weight: float,
    ) -> Fruit:
        # resolve_node will return an awaitable that returns the Fruit object
        fruit = await id.resolve_node(info, ensure_type=Fruit)
        fruit.weight = weight
        return fruit

    @strawberry.mutation
    def update_fruit_weight_sync(
        self,
        info: Info,
        id: relay.GlobalID,
        weight: float,
    ) -> Fruit:
        # resolve_node will return the Fruit object
        fruit = id.resolve_node_sync(info, ensure_type=Fruit)
        fruit.weight = weight
        return fruit
```

In the example above, you can also access the type name directly with `id.type_name`,
the raw node ID with `id.id`, or even resolve the type itself with `id.resolve_type(info)`.
