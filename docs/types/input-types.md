# Input types

In addition to [object types](./object-types) GraphQL also supports input types. While being similar to object types, they are better suited for input data as they limit the kind of types you can use for fields.

This is how the [GraphQL spec defines the difference between object types and input types](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Input-Objects):

> The GraphQL Object type (ObjectTypeDefinition)... is inappropriate for re‐use (as input), because Object types can contain fields that define arguments or contain references to interfaces and unions, neither of which is appropriate for use as an input argument. For this reason, input objects have a separate type in the system.

## Defining input types

In Strawberry, you can define input types by using the `@strawberry.input` decorator, like this:

```python+schema
import strawberry

@strawberry.input
class Point2D:
    x: float
    y: float

---

input Point2D {
  x: Float!
  y: Float!
}
```

Then you can use input types as argument for your fields or mutations:

```python
import strawberry

@strawberry.type
class Mutation:
    @strawberry.mutation
    def store_point(self, a: Point2D) -> bool:
        return True
```

## API

`@strawberry.type(name: str = None, description: str = None)`

Creates an input type from a class definition.

- `name`: if set this will be the GraphQL name, otherwise the GraphQL will be generated by camel-casing the name of the class.
- `description`: this is the GraphQL description that will be returned when introspecting the schema or when navigating the schema using GraphiQL.
