# Object types

Object types are the fundamentals of any GraphQL schema, the are used to defined the kind of objects that exist in a schema. Object types are created by defining a name and a list of fields, here’s an example object type defined using the GraphQL schema language:

```graphql
type Character {
  name: String!
  age: Int!
}
```

## A note on Query, Mutation and Subscription

While reading about GraphQL you might have encounter 3 special object types: `Query`, `Mutation` and `Subscription`. They are defined as standard object types, with the difference that they are also used as entry point for your schema (also referred as root types).

- `Query` is the entry point for all the query operations
- `Mutation` is the entry point for all the mutations
- `Subscription` is the entry point for all the subscriptions.

. TODO: add a link to docs on defining a schema.

## Defining object types

In Strawberry, you can define object types by using the `@strawberry.type` decorator, like this:

```python+schema
import strawberry

@strawberry.type
class Character:
    name: str
    age: int

---

type Character {
  name: String!
  age: Age!
}
```

You can also refer to other types, like this:

```python+schema
import strawberry

@strawberry.type
class Character:
    name: str
    age: int

@strawberry.type
class Book:
    title: str
    main_character: str

---

type Character {
  name: String!
  age: Age!
}

type Book {
  title: String!
  mainCharacter: Character!
}
```

## API

`@strawberry.type(name: str = None, description: str = None)`

Creates an object type from a class definition.

`name`: if set this will be the GraphQL name, otherwise the GraphQL will be generated by camel-casing the name of the class.

`description`: this is the GraphQL description that will be returned when introspecting the schema or when navigating the schema using GraphiQL.
