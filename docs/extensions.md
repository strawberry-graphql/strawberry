# Extensions

Extensions allow you, as an application developer, to customise the GraphQL
execution flow based on your needs. Strawberry provides multiple built in
extensions that allow you to extend the capability of your GraphQL server.

If you can't find what you need among the
[built-in extensions](#built-in-extensions), you can also build your own custom
extension based on a standard interface. Check out the
[schema extensions](./guides/custom-extensions.md) and
[field extensions](./guides/field-extensions.md) guides to find out more.
