# Why was Strawberry created?

Strawberry has been inspired by dataclasses[^1] and one of its goals is to
provide a great developer experience for both GraphQL beginners and advanced
users.

In addition to that we really want to create and foster a nice and welcoming
community with people using GraphQL in python.

Thanks to type hints and the decorator syntax inspired by dataclasses,
Strawberry provides a nice developer experience that will help writing better
GraphQL APIs while also helping finding bugs when using type checkers like MyPy.

We also are going to provide useful features and integrations, for example we
provide support for Apollo Federation, File Uploads, Permissions and integration
with popular frameworks like Django, ASGI and Flask.

Finally we try to fix bugs and provide help via GitHub or our discord channel,
so if you have any issue feel free to drop an issue or ask on discord.
