# Upgrading Strawberry

<!--alex ignore-->

We try to keep Strawberry as backwards compatible as possible, but sometimes we
need to make updates to the public API. While we try to deprecate APIs before
removing them, we also want to make it as easy as possible to upgrade to the
latest version of Strawberry.

For this reason we provide a CLI command that can automatically upgrade your
codebase to use the updated APIs.

At the moment we only support updating unions to use the new syntax with
annotated, but in future we plan to add more commands to help with upgrading.

Here's how you can use the command to upgrade your codebase:

```shell
strawberry upgrade annotated-union .
```
