# This is a test doc page

Some examples of things you can do in docs.

## Code highlighting

Code blocks now support:

### Highlighting words individually

```python highlight=strawberry,str
import strawberry


@strawberry.type
class X:
    name: str
```

### Highlighting lines

```python lines=1-4
import strawberry


@strawberry.type
class X:
    name: str
```

### Add notes to code comments

This is probably not implemented in the best way, but for now it works:

```python
import strawberry

#      ^^^^^^^^^^
#      This is a note about this line


# this is a standard comment
@strawberry.type
class X:
    name: str
```

### Split code blocks

You can show two different code blocks next to each other (useful when comparing
the GraphQL schema against the Python definition):

```python+schema
import strawberry

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @strawberry.field
    def ping(self) -> str:
        return "pong"
---
type Query {
    ping: String!
}
```

or when showing the request and response to a query:

```graphql+response
{
  ping
}
---
{
  "data": {
    "ping": "pong"
  }
}
```

## Blockquote

> This is a quote

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    Bob-->>John: How about you John?
    Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
    Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
    Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

    Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
    Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
```
