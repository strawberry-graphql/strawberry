# v0.285.0 Breaking Changes

This release changes the default Apollo Federation version from being
unspecified to version 2.11 (the latest supported version).

## What Changed

Previously, when creating a federation schema without specifying a version, the
code would internally default to version 2.11. Now this default is explicit:

```python
# Before (0.284.x and earlier)
schema = strawberry.federation.Schema(query=Query)
# Internally defaulted to 2.11, but federation_version parameter accepted None

# After (0.285.0+)
schema = strawberry.federation.Schema(query=Query)
# Explicitly defaults to "2.11", federation_version no longer accepts None
```

## Impact on Your Code

### Most Users - No Changes Required

If you were creating federation schemas without specifying a version, your code
will continue to work exactly as before:

```python
# This works in both versions
schema = strawberry.federation.Schema(query=Query)
```

The only difference is that the version is now explicitly "2.11" rather than
being implicitly determined.

### Type Checking

If you're using type checkers and explicitly passing `None` as the
`federation_version`, you'll need to either:

1. Remove the explicit `None` (recommended):

   ```python
   # Before
   schema = strawberry.federation.Schema(query=Query, federation_version=None)

   # After
   schema = strawberry.federation.Schema(query=Query)
   ```

2. Or specify a version explicitly:
   ```python
   schema = strawberry.federation.Schema(query=Query, federation_version="2.11")
   ```

### Runtime Behavior

The runtime behavior is **unchanged** - schemas without an explicit version
still use v2.11, as they did before. This change makes the default explicit in
the API.

## Why This Change?

This change provides several benefits:

1. **Clarity**: The default version is now explicit rather than implicit
2. **Better API**: Removes unnecessary conditional logic checking for `None`
3. **Type Safety**: Cleaner type signatures without `| None`
4. **Performance**: Simplified version parsing using dictionary lookups

## Migration

### Automatic Migration

No automatic migration is needed - most code will work without changes.

### Manual Migration

If you explicitly pass `None`:

```python
# Change this:
schema = strawberry.federation.Schema(query=Query, federation_version=None)

# To this:
schema = strawberry.federation.Schema(query=Query)
```

### Specifying a Different Version

If you need a specific federation version, you can still specify it:

```python
schema = strawberry.federation.Schema(
    query=Query, federation_version="2.5"  # Any version from 2.0 to 2.11
)
```

Supported versions: 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10, 2.11
