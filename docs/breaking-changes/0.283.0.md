# v0.283.0 Breaking Changes

In this release, we renamed the `strawberry server` command to `strawberry dev`
to better reflect its purpose as a development server. The old command will
print a deprecation warning for now and will be removed in a future release.

We also deprecated the `strawberry-graphql[debug-server]` extra in favor of
`strawberry-graphql[cli]`. Please update your dependencies accordingly.

## Migrate Dependencies

If you were using the `strawberry-graphql[debug-server]` extra in your project,
please update it to `strawberry-graphql[cli]`.

## Migrate Scripts

If you previously used the command:

```bash
strawberry server
```

Please update it to:

```bash
strawberry dev
```
