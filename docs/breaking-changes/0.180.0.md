# v0.180.0 introduces a breaking change for the Django Channels HTTP integration

The context object is now a `dict`. This means that you should access the context
value using the `["key"]` syntax instead of the `.key` syntax.

For the HTTP integration, there is also no `ws` key anymore and `request` is a custom
request object containing the full request instead of a `GraphQLHTTPConsumer` instance.
If you need to access the `GraphQLHTTPConsumer` instance in a HTTP connection, you can
access it via `info.context["request"].consumer`.

For the WebSockets integration, the context keys did not change, e.g. the values for
`info.context["ws"]`, `info.context["request"]` and `info.context["connection_params"]`
are the same as before.

If you still want to use the `.key` syntax, you can override `get_context()`
to return a custom dataclass there. See the Channels integration documentation
for an example.
