# v0.146.0 Breaking Changes - 5 December 2022

This release introduces a couple of breaking changes to the Sanic integration.

## `process_result` is now async and accepts the request as the first argument

If you customized the `process_result` function, you will need to update your
code to make it async and accept the request as the first argument.

For example:

```python
from strawberry.sanic.views import GraphQLView
from strawberry.http import GraphQLHTTPResponse, process_result
from strawberry.types import ExecutionResult
from sanic.request import Request
from graphql.error.graphql_error import format_error as format_graphql_error


class MyGraphQLView(GraphQLView):
    async def process_result(
        self, request: Request, result: ExecutionResult
    ) -> GraphQLHTTPResponse:
        if result.errors:
            result.errors = [format_graphql_error(err) for err in result.errors]

        return process_result(data)
```

## `get_context` now receives also the response as the second argument

If you customized the `get_context` function, you will need to update your code
to accept the response as the second argument. The response argument allows you
to set cookies and other headers.

For example:

```python
from strawberry.sanic.views import GraphQLView
from strawberry.sanic.context import StrawberrySanicContext
from strawberry.http.temporal_response import TemporalResponse
from sanic.request import Request


class MyGraphQLView(GraphQLView):
    async def get_context(
        self, request: Request, response: TemporalResponse
    ) -> StrawberrySanicContext:
        return {"request": request, "response": response}
```

# Deprecations

## Context value is now a dictionary

The context value is now a dictionary instead of a custom class. This means that
you should access the context value using the `["key"]` syntax instead of the
`.key` syntax.

The `.key` syntax is still supported but will be removed in future releases.
