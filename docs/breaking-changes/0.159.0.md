# v0.159.0 Introduces changes how extension hooks are defined

This release changes how extension hooks are defined. The new style hooks are
more flexible and allow to run code before and after the execution.

The old style hooks are still supported but will be removed in future releases.

# How to upgrade

## Before:

```python
class MyExtension(Extension):
    def on_executing_start(self):
        ...

    def on_executing_end(self):
        ...
```

## After

```python
class MyExtension(Extension):
    def on_execute(self):
        # code before the execution starts
        yield
        # code after the execution ends
```

# Migration guide

See the following table for a mapping between the old and new hooks.

| Old hook            | New hook     |
| ------------------- | ------------ |
| on_request_start    | on_operation |
| on_request_end      | on_operation |
| on_validation_start | on_validate  |
| on_validation_end   | on_validate  |
| on_parsing_start    | on_parse     |
| on_parsing_end      | on_parse     |
