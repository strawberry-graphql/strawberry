# v0.169.0 Introduces a couple of breaking changes in the HTTP integrations

## Flask

Both `get_root_value` and `get_context` now receive the request as a parameter.

If you're customizing these methods you can change the signature to:

```python
def get_root_value(self, request: Request) -> Any:
    ...


def get_context(self, request: Request, response: Response) -> Any:
    ...
```

The same is true for the async version of the view.

## Sanic

The `get_root_value` method now receives the request as a parameter and it is
async.

If you're customizing this method you can change the signature to:

```python
async def get_root_value(self, request: Request) -> Any:
    ...
```
