# v0.278.1 Breaking Changes

This release removes `strawberry.http.exceptions`. HTTP-related exceptions can
now be imported directly from the `lia` package.

For example, instead of:

```python
from strawberry.http.exceptions import HTTPException
```

Now you need to do:

```python
from lia import HTTPException
```
