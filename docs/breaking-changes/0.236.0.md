# v0.236.0 changes some of the imports

This release changes the location of some files in the codebase, this is to make
the codebase more organized and easier to navigate.

Technically most of these changes should not affect you, but if you were
importing some of the files directly you will need to update the imports.

We created a codemod to help you with that, feel free to try and submit bugs if
we missed something.

```bash
strawberry upgrade update-imports
```
