# Relay wrong resolver annotation error

## Description

This error is thrown when a field on a relay connection was defined with
a resolver that returns something that is not compatible with pagination.

For example, the following code would throw this error:

```python
from typing import Any

import strawberry
from strawberry import relay


@strawberry.type
class MyType(relay.Node):
    ...


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @relay.connection(relay.Connection[MyType])
    def some_connection_returning_mytype(self) -> MyType:
        ...

    @relay.connection(relay.Connection[MyType])
    def some_connection_returning_any(self) -> Any:
        ...
```

This happens because the connection resolver needs to return something that can
be paginated, usually an iterable/generator of the connection type itself.

## How to fix this error

You can fix this error by annotating the resolver with one of the following
supported types:

- `List[<NodeType>]`
- `Iterator[<NodeType>]`
- `Iterable[<NodeType>]`
- `AsyncIterator[<NodeType>]`
- `AsyncIterable[<NodeType>]`
- `Generator[<NodeType>, Any, Any]`
- `AsyncGenerator[<NodeType>, Any]`

For example:

```python
from typing import Any

import strawberry
from strawberry import relay


@strawberry.type
class MyType(relay.Node):
    ...


@strawberry.type
class Query:
    @relay.connection(relay.Connection[MyType])
    def some_connection(self) -> Iterable[MyType]:
        ...
```

<Note>

Note that if you are returning a type different than the connection type,
you will need to subclass the connection type and override its
`resolve_node` method to convert it to the correct type, as explained in
the [relay guide](../guides/relay).
