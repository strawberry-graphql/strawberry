Release type: minor

This release drops support for Python 3.8, which has reached EOL on
October 2024. The minimum supported Python version is now 3.9.

It's recommended to upgrade to Python 3.9 or preferably a newer version, as
older versions are no longer supported by the Python Software Foundation itself
and thus may contain security vulnerabilities.
