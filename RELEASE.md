Release type: patch

Grammar fixes - changed 'corresponding tests, if tests' to 'corresponding tests. If tests' and removed extraneous period from 'Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps..'. Also made 'Enhancement' lowercase to stay consistent with its usage in documentation and changed 'on the Strawberry' to 'to Strawberry'.
