Release type: minor

This release introduced improved errors! Now, when you have a syntax error in
your code, you'll get a nice error message with a line number and a pointer to
the exact location of the error. âœ¨

This is a huge improvement over the previous behavior, which was providing a
stack trace with no clear indication of where the error was. ðŸ™ˆ

You can enable rich errors by installing Strawberry with the `cli` extra:

```bash
pip install strawberry-graphql[cli]
```
